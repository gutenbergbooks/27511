<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>FLINGING THE GAUNTLET</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Then you insist on ruining me, Mr. Bissell?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bud Larkin, his hat pushed back on his head,
looked unabashed at the scowling heavy features
of the man opposite in the long, low room, and
awaited a reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to ruin anybody,&#8221; puffed old
&#8220;Beef&#8221; Bissell, whose cattle overran most of the
range between the Gray Bull and the Big Horn.
&#8220;But I allow as how them sheep of yours had
better stay down Nebrasky way where they come
from.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In other words,&#8221; snapped Larkin, &#8220;I had
better give up the idea of bringing them north
altogether. Is that it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now, see here, Mr. Bissell, you forget
one or two things. The first is, that my sheep
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
ranch is in Montana and not Wyoming, and that
I want to run my southern herds onto the northern
range before fall sets in. The second is,
that, while your homestead may be three hundred
and twenty acres, the range that has made you
rich is free. My sheep have as much right there
as your cattle. It is all government land and
open to everybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Possession is eleven points out here where
there isn&#8217;t any law,&#8221; replied Bissell imperturbably.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a case of your sheep against my cattle, and,
you see, I stand up reg&#8217;lar for my cows.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bud rolled a cigarette and pondered.</p>
<p>He was in the rather bare and unornamental
living-room of the Bar T ranch. In the center
was a rough-hewn table supporting an oil-lamp
and an Omaha newspaper fully six months old.
The chairs, except one, were rough and heavy and
without rockers. This one was a gorgeous plush
patent-rocker so valued a generation ago, and evidently
imported at great expense.</p>
<p>A square of carpet that had lost all claims to
pattern had become a soft blur, the result of
age and alkali. However, it was one of the
proudest possessions of the Bar T outfit and
showed that old Beef Bissell knew what the right
thing was. A calico shroud hid a large, erect object
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
against the wall farthest away from the windows;
an object that was the last word in luxury
and reckless expense&mdash;a piano. The walls were
of boards whitewashed, and the ceiling was just
plain boards.</p>
<p>It had not taken Bud Larkin long to discern
that there was a feminine cause for these numerous
unusual effects; but he did not for a minute
suppose it to be the thin, sharp-tongued woman
who had been washing behind the cook-house as
he rode up to the corral. Now, as he pondered,
he thought again about it. But only for a minute;
other things of vaster importance held him.</p>
<p>Although but two men had spoken during the
conversation, three were in the room. The third
was a man of medium height, lowering looks, and
slow tongue. His hair was black, and he had
the appearance of always needing a shave. He
was trained down to perfect condition by his
years on the plains, and was as wiry and tough
as the cow pony he rode. He was Black Mike
Stelton, foreman of the Bar T.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think, Mike?&#8221; asked Bissell,
when Larkin made no attempt to continue the
argument.</p>
<p>&#8220;Same&#8217;s you, boss,&#8221; was the reply in a heavy
voice. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t let them sheep on the range,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
not noways. Sheep is the ruination of any grass
country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There you see, Mr. Larkin,&#8221; said Bissell
with an expressive motion of his hand. &#8220;Stelton&#8217;s
been out here in the business fifteen years
and says the same as I do. How long did you
say you had been in the West?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One year,&#8221; replied Larkin, flushing to the
roots of his hair beneath his tanned but not
weather-beaten skin. &#8220;Came from Chicago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From down East, eh? Well, my woman
was to St. Paul once, and she&#8217;s never got over it;
but it don&#8217;t seem to have spoiled you none.&#8221;</p>
<p>Larkin grinned and replied in kind, but all
the time he was trying to determine what stand
to take. He had expected to meet opposition
to &#8220;walking&#8221; his sheep north&mdash;in fact, had
met it steadily&mdash;but up to this point had managed
to get his animals through. Now he was
fifty miles ahead of the first flock and had reached
the Bar T ranch an hour before dinner.</p>
<p>Had he been a suspected horse-thief, the unwritten
social etiquette of the plains would have provided
him with food and lodging as long as he
cared to stay. Consequently when he had caught
the reflection of the setting sun against the walls
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
of the ranch house, he had turned Pinte&#8217;s head
in the direction of the corral.</p>
<p>Then, in the living-room, though no questions
had been asked, Larkin had brought up the much-dreaded
subject himself, as his visit was partly for
that purpose.</p>
<p>He had much to contend with. In the first
place, being a sheepman, he was absolutely without
caste in the cattle country, where men who
went in for the &#8220;woolly idiots,&#8221; as someone has
aptly called them, was considered for the most part
as a degenerate, and only fit for target practice.
This side of the matter troubled him not at all,
however.</p>
<p>What did worry him was the element of right
in the cattlemen&#8217;s attitude! a right that was still a
wrong. For he had to acknowledge that when
sheep had once fed across a range, that range was
ruined for cattle for the period of at least a year.</p>
<p>This was due to the fact that the sheep, cropping
into the very roots of the gray grass itself,
destroyed it. Moreover, the animals on their
slow marches, herded so close together that they
left an offensive trail rather than follow which
the cattle would stand and starve.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the range was free and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
sheep had as much right to graze there as the
cattle, a fact that the cattlemen, with all their strict
code of justice, refused to recognize.</p>
<p>Larkin knew that he had come to the parting of
the ways at the Bar T ranch.</p>
<p>Old Beef Bissell was what was known at that
time as a cattle king. His thousands of steers,
wealth on the hoof, grazed far and wide over the
fenceless prairies. His range riders rarely saw
the ranch house for a month at a time, so great
was his assumed territory; his cowboys outnumbered
those of any owner within three hundred
miles. Aside from this, he was the head of a
cattlemen&#8217;s association that had banded together
against rustlers and other invaders of the range.</p>
<p>Larkin returned to the conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Try to see it from my standpoint,&#8221; he said
to Bissell. &#8220;If you had gone in for sheep as I
have&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t go in for &#8217;em,&#8221; interrupted the
other contemptuously, and Stelton grunted.</p>
<p>&#8220;As you like about that. Every gopher to his
own hole,&#8221; remarked Bud. &#8220;But if you had, and
I guess you would if you thought there was more
money in it, you would certainly insist on your
rights on the range, wouldn&#8217;t you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I might try.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if you tried you&#8217;d be pretty sure to succeed,
I imagine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s likely; I allow as how I&#8217;m a pretty good
hand at succeedin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, so am I. I haven&#8217;t got very far yet,
but I am on my way. I didn&#8217;t come out here to
make a failure of things, and I don&#8217;t intend to.
Now, all I want is to run my sheep north on to the
Montana range where my ranch is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How many are there?&#8221; This from Stelton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Five flocks of about two thousand each.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bissell snorted and turned in his chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t allow it, young man, an&#8217; that&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve
got to say. D&#8217;ye think I&#8217;m a fool?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but neither am I. And I might as well
tell you first and last that those sheep are coming
north. Now, if you do the fair thing you will tell
your cowboys the fact so they won&#8217;t make any
mistakes. I have given you fair warning, and if
anything happens to those sheep you will be held
responsible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that all you got to say?&#8221; asked Bissell, sarcastically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, I&#8217;ll do the talkin&#8217;. I&#8217;d as leave
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
see Indians stampedin&#8217; my cows into the river as
have your sheep come over the range. Since
you&#8217;ve given me what you call a fair warning, I&#8217;ll
give you one. Leave your critters where they are.
If you don&#8217;t do it you&#8217;ll be a sight wiser and also
a mighty sight poorer before I get through with
&#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just what do you mean by that?&#8221; asked Larkin.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t sayin&#8217; nothin&#8217; more than that now,
because I&#8217;m a slow hand at makin&#8217; ornery promises,
seein&#8217; I always keep &#8217;em. But I&#8217;m just tellin&#8217;
you, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that your last word on the subject?&#8221; asked
Larkin.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is, an&#8217; I want Stelton here to remember I
said it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we won&#8217;t say anything more about the
matter,&#8221; replied Bud calmly, as he rose. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go
outside and look to my horse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll stay the night with us, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;
asked Bissell anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, thanks. I&#8217;ve heard so much about the
Bar T I should like to see a little more of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Larkin had left the room, Bissell, with
a frown on his face, turned to Stelton.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Tell all the boys what&#8217;s happened to-day,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;and tell &#8217;em to be on the watch for this
young feller&#8217;s first herd. He&#8217;ll plenty soon find
out he can&#8217;t run riot on my range.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>A LATE ARRIVAL</h3>
</div>

<p>After visiting the corral, Larkin paid his respects
to the pump and refreshed himself
for supper. Then he strolled around the long,
rambling ranch house. Across the front, which
faced southwest, had been built a low apology for
a veranda on which a couple of uninviting chairs
stood. He appropriated one of these and settled
back to think.</p>
<p>The late sun, a red-bronze color, hung just
above the horizon and softened the unlovely
stretches of prairie into something brooding and
beautiful. Thirty miles away the Rockies had become
a mass of gray-blue fleeced across the top
with lines of late snow&mdash;for it was early June.</p>
<p>The Bar T ranch house itself stood on a rise
of ground back from a cold, greenish-blue river
that made a bend at this point, and that rose
and had its being in the melting whiteness of those
distant peaks. Between the willows of the river
bottoms, Larkin could see the red reflection of the
sun on the water, and could follow the stream&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
course across the prairie by the snake-like procession
of cottonwoods that lined its banks.</p>
<p>On the plains themselves there was still a fading
hue of green. The buffalo grass had already
begun to wither under the increasing heat, and in
a month would have become the same gray, cured
fodder that supported millions of buffalo centuries
before a steer was on the range.</p>
<p>For Bud Larkin, only a year in the West, this
evening scene had not lost its charm. He loved
this hour when the men washed up at the pump.
There were enticing sounds from the cook house
and enticing odors in the air. Sometimes it
seemed as though it almost made up for a day&#8217;s
failure and discouragement.</p>
<p>His quick eye suddenly noted a dark speck moving
rapidly across the prairie toward the ranch
house. It seemed to skim the ground and in five
minutes had developed into a cow pony and its
rider. A quarter of an hour later and the pony
proved himself of &#8220;calico&#8221; variety, while the
rider developed into a girl who bestrode her mount
as though she were a part of the animal itself.</p>
<p>The front rim of her broad felt hat was fastened
upward with a thong and exposed her face.
Bud watched her idly until she dashed up to the
front of the house, fetched her horse back on its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
haunches with a jerk on the cruel Spanish bridle,
and leaped to the ground before he had fairly
lost headway. Then with a slap on the rump she
sent him trotting to Stelton, who had appeared
around the end of the veranda as though expecting
her.</p>
<p>Occupied with pulling off her soft white buckskin
gauntlets, she did not notice the young man on
the low porch until, with an exclamation, he had
sprung to his feet and hurried toward her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Juliet Bissell!&#8221; gasped Larkin, holding out
a hand to her. &#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of all people, Bud Larkin!&#8221; cried the girl,
flushing with pleasure. &#8220;Why, I can&#8217;t believe it!
Did you drop out of the sky somewhere?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If the sky is heaven, I&#8217;ve just dropped into
it,&#8221; he returned, trying to confine his joy to intelligible
speech, and barely succeeding.</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds like the same old Bud,&#8221; she
laughed, &#8220;and it&#8217;s a pleasure to hear it. For if
there is one thing a cowboy can&#8217;t do, and it&#8217;s the
only one, it is to pay a woman a compliment.
That speech brands you a tenderfoot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never! I&#8217;ve been out a year and can nearly
ride a cow pony, providing it is lame and blind.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, bantering each other unmercifully, they
reached the front door.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a few minutes, Bud, and I will be out
again. I must dress for dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>When she had gone Larkin understood at once
the presence of the carpet, the patent rocker, and
the piano.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a double-barreled idiot I am,&#8221; he swore,
&#8220;to talk turkey to old Bissell and never connect
him with Juliet. All the sheep in the world
couldn&#8217;t get me away from here to-night.&#8221; And
he ejaculated the time-worn but true old phrase
that the world is a mighty small place.</p>
<p>Juliet Bissell had been a very definite personage
in Bud Larkin&#8217;s other life&mdash;the life that he tried
to forget. The eldest son of a rich Chicago
banker, his first twenty-five years had been such
years as a man always looks back upon with a vast
regret.</p>
<p>From the mansion on Sheridan Drive he had
varied his time among his clubs, his sports, and
his social duties, and generally made himself one
of many in this world that humanity can do without.
In other words, he added nothing to himself,
others, or life in general, and was, therefore,
without a real excuse for existing.</p>
<p>Of one thing he was ever zealous, now that he
had left it behind, and this was that his past should
not pursue him into the new life he had chosen.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
He wished to start his career without stigma, and
end it without blame.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, the person who had implanted
this ambition and determination in him was Juliet
Bissell. Three winters before, he had met her at
the charity ball, and at the time she was something
of a social sensation, being described as &#8220;that
cowgirl from Wyoming.&#8221; However, that &#8220;cowgirl&#8221;
left her mark on many a gilded youth, and
Bud Larkin was one.</p>
<p>He had fallen in love with her, as much as one
in his position is capable of falling in love, had
proposed to her, and been rejected with a grace
and gentleness that had robbed the blow of all
hurt&mdash;with one exception. Bud&#8217;s pride, since
his wealth and position had meant nothing in the
girl&#8217;s eyes, had been sorely wounded, and it had
taken six months of the vast mystery of the plains
to reduce this pettiness to the status of a secret
shame.</p>
<p>When Juliet refused him she had told him
with infinite tact that her husband would be a man
more after the pattern of her father, whom she
adored, and who, in turn, worshiped the very air
that surrounded her; and it was this fact that
had turned Bud&#8217;s attention to the West and its
opportunities.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span></p>
<p>When she returned to the porch Juliet had on
a plain white dress with pink ribbons at elbows,
neck, and waist. Larkin, who had always thrilled
at her splendid physical vigor, found himself
more than ever under the spell of her luxuriant
vitality.</p>
<p>Her great dark eyes were remarkably lustrous
and expressive, her black hair waved back from
her brown face into a great braided coil, her
features were not pretty so much as noble. Her
figure, with its limber curves, was pliant and graceful
in any position or emergency&mdash;the result of
years in the saddle. Her feet and hands were
small, the latter being firm but infinitely gentle in
their touch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, have you forgotten all your Eastern
education?&#8221; Larkin asked, smiling, as she sat
down. &#8220;Have you reverted to your original untamed
condition?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed, Bud. I have a reputation to keep
up in that respect. The fact that I have had an
Eastern education has made our punchers so proud
that they can&#8217;t be lived with when they go to town,
and lord it over everybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose they all want to marry you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, singly or in lots, and sometimes I&#8217;m sorry
it can&#8217;t be done, I love them all so much. But tell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
me, Bud, what brings you out West in general and
here in particular?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably you don&#8217;t know that a year and a
half ago my father died,&#8221; and Larkin&#8217;s face
shadowed for a moment with retrospection.
&#8220;Well, he did, and left me most of his estate.
I was sick of it there, and I vowed I would pull up
stakes and start somewhere by myself. So I went
up to Montana in the vicinity of the Musselshell
Forks and bought a ranch and some stock.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cattle?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sheep. The best merino I ever saw&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bud Larkin! You&#8217;re not a sheepman?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am, and a menace to a large number
of cowmen, your father among them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl sank back and allowed him to relate
the story of his adventures up to the present time,
including the interview with Beef. At the description
of that she smiled grimly; and he, noting the
fact, told himself that it would take a masterly
character to subdue that free, wild pride.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Julie,&#8221; he concluded, &#8220;do me the favor
of instilling reason into your father. I&#8217;ve done
my best and we have parted without murder, but
that&#8217;s all. I&#8217;ve got to have a friend at court or
I will be ruined before I commence.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></p>
<p>The girl was silent for a few minutes and sat
looking down at her slippered feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bud,&#8221; she said at last, &#8220;you&#8217;ve never known
me to tell anything but the truth, and I&#8217;m going
to tell it to you now. I will be your friend in
everything except where you ask me to yield my
loyalty to my father and his interests. He is the
most wonderful father a girl ever had, and if he
were to say that black was white, I should probably
swear to it if he asked me to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I admire you for that,&#8221; said Bud genuinely,
although all his hopes in this powerful ally went
glimmering. &#8220;Let&#8217;s not talk shop any longer.
It&#8217;s too good just to see you to think about anything
but that.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, for a while, they reminisced of the days of
their former friendship, by tacit agreement avoiding
any reference to intimate things. And Larkin
felt spring up in him the old love that he had convinced
himself was dead; so that he added to his
first resolution to succeed on the range, a second,
that he would, in the end, conquer Juliet Bissell.</p>
<p>The thought was pleasing, for it meant another
struggle, another outlet for the energies and activities
that had so long lain dormant in him. And
with the undaunted courage of youth he looked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
eagerly toward the battle that should win this
radiant girl.</p>
<p>But for the present he knew he must not betray
himself by word, look or action; other things of
greater moment must be settled.</p>
<p>At last, as they talked, the cook, a long-suffering
Chinaman, seized a huge brass bell and rang
it with all his might, standing in the door of the
cook house.</p>
<p>There was an instant response in the wild whoop
of the cowboys who had been suffering the pangs
of starvation for the past half-hour.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you must come to our private table,
Bud,&#8221; said Juliet. &#8220;I want you to see father&#8217;s
other side.&#8221; So they rose and went in the front
way.</p>
<p>The ranch house had been planned so that to
the right of the entrance was the living-room, and
back of that the dining-room. To the left three
smaller rooms had been made into sleeping apartments.
At the back of the structure and extending
across the width of it was a large room that, in
the early days of the Bar T, had served as the
bunk-house for the cow punchers.</p>
<p>This had now been changed to the mess-room
for them, while the family, with the addition of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
Stelton, the foreman, used the smaller private
room. Owing to the large increase in the number
of Bar T punchers a special bunk-house had been
built in the rear of the main structure.</p>
<p>At table Larkin for the first time met Mrs.
Bissell, who proved to be a typical early cowman&#8217;s
wife, thin, overworked, and slightly vinegary of
disposition, despite the fact that she had at one
time in her life been the belle of a cowtown, and
had been won from beneath the ready .45&#8217;s of a
number of rivals.</p>
<p>At Bud&#8217;s entrance Stelton grunted and scowled,
and generally showed himself ill-pleased that Juliet
should have known the visitor. On the other
hand, as the girl had promised, Beef Bissell, for
years the terror of the range, displayed a side that
the sheepman would never have suspected. His
voice became gentle, his laugh softened, his language
purified, and he showed, by many little attentions,
the unconscious chivalry that worship of
a good woman brings to the surface.</p>
<p>For her part, the girl appraised this devotion
at its true value and never failed in the little feminine
thoughtfulnesses that appeal so strongly to a
worried and busy man.</p>
<p>That Stelton should be at the table at all surprised
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
Bud, for it was not the habit of foremen to
eat away from the punchers. But here the fact
was the result of a former necessity when Bissell,
hard-pressed, had called his foreman into consultation
at meal times.</p>
<p>Old Bissell proved himself a more genial host
than business rival, and when he had learned of
Larkin and his daughter&#8217;s former friendship, he
forgot sheep for the moment and took an interest
in the man. Mrs. Bissell sat open-mouthed while
Bud told of the glories of Chicago in the early
eighties, and never once mentioned her famous
visit to St. Paul, so overcome was she with the
tales this young man related.</p>
<p>Everyone was at his or her ease when the rapid
tattoo of hoofs was heard, and a horse and rider
drew up abruptly at the corral. One of the
punchers from the rear dining-room went out to
meet him and presently appeared sheepishly in the
doorway where Bissell could see him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there a Mr. Larkin here?&#8221; asked the
puncher.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Bud, pushing back his chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a stranger out here that &#8217;lows he
wants to see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Send him in here and give him something to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
eat, Shorty,&#8221; sang out Bissell. &#8220;If he&#8217;s a friend
of Larkin&#8217;s, he&#8217;d better have dinner with him.
And, Shorty, tell that Chinaman to rustle another
place here <i>pronto!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>As for Bud Larkin, he was at a total loss to
know who his visitor might be. With a sudden
twinge of fear he thought that perhaps Hard-winter
Sims, his chief herder, had pursued him with
disastrous information from the flocks. Wondering,
he awaited the visitor&#8217;s appearance.</p>
<p>The stranger presently made a bold and noisy
entrance, and, when his face came into view, Bud
sank back in his chair weakly, his own paling a
trifle beneath the tan. For the man was Smithy
Caldwell, a shifty-eyed crook from Chicago, one
who had dogged him before, and whom he had
never expected to see again. How the villain had
tracked him to the Bar T outfit Bud could not
imagine.</p>
<p>Seeing the eyes of the others upon him, Larkin
recovered himself with an effort and introduced
Caldwell; but to the eyes of even the most unobservant
it was plain that a foreign element of disturbing
nature had suddenly been projected into
the genial atmosphere. The man was coarse in
manner and speech and often addressed leering remarks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
to Juliet, who disregarded them utterly and
confined her attention to Bud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is this creature?&#8221; she asked <i>sotto voce</i>.
&#8220;What does he want with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bud hesitated, made two or three false starts,
and finally said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure his business with me would not interest
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; said the girl, rebuffed.
&#8220;I seem to have forgotten myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I could,&#8221; ejaculated Bud bitterly, and
refused to explain further.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>AN UNSETTLED SCORE</h3>
</div>

<p>As soon after dinner as possible Larkin disengaged
himself from the rest of the party
and motioned Caldwell to follow him. He led
the way around the house and back toward the
fence of the corral. It was already dark, and the
only sounds were those of the horses stirring restlessly,
or the low bellow of one of the ranch milch
cows.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing out here?&#8221; demanded
Bud.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came to see you.&#8221; The other emitted an
exasperating chuckle at his own cheap wit.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know what I want.&#8221; This time there
was no chuckle, and Bud could imagine the close-set,
greedy eyes of the other, one of them slightly
crossed, boring into him in the dark.</p>
<p>&#8220;Money, I suppose, you whining blood-sucker,&#8221;
suggested Bud, his voice quiet, but holding a cold,
unpleasant sort of ring that was new to Caldwell.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;The boy guessed right the very first time,&#8217;&#8221;
quoted Smithy, unabashed.</p>
<p>&#8220;What became of that two thousand I gave you
before I left Chicago?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I got little enough of that,&#8221; cried Caldwell.
&#8220;You know how many people there were to be
hushed up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Many!&#8221; snapped Larkin. &#8220;You can&#8217;t come
any of that on me. There were just three; yourself,
your wife, and that red-headed fellow,&mdash;I
forget his name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, my wife doesn&#8217;t live with me any more,&#8221;
whined Smithy, &#8220;but she makes me support her
just the same, and threatens to squeal on you if I
don&#8217;t produce regularly; she knows where the
money comes from.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly Larkin stepped close to the other and
thrust something long and hard against his ribs.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to do for you now, Smithy,&#8221; he
said in a cold, even voice. Caldwell did not even
move from his position.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you do,&#8221; was his reply, &#8220;the woman will
give the whole thing to the newspapers. They
have smelled a rat so long they would pay well
for a tip. She has all the documents. So if you
want to swing and ruin everybody concerned, just
pull that trigger.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I knew you were lying.&#8221; Bud stepped back
and thrust his revolver into the holster. &#8220;You
are still living with your wife, for she wouldn&#8217;t
have the documents if you weren&#8217;t. A man rarely
lies when he is within two seconds of death. You
are up to your old tricks, Smithy, and they have
never fooled me yet. Now, let&#8217;s get down to
business. How much do you want?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two thousand dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t got it. You don&#8217;t know it, perhaps,
but my money is on the hoof out in this
country, and cash is very little used. Look here.
You bring your wife and that red-headed chap out
to Arizona or California and I will set you up in
the sheep business. I&#8217;ve got herds coming north
now, but I&#8217;ll turn a thousand back in your name,
and by the time you arrive they will be on the
southern range. What do you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I say no,&#8221; replied the other in an ugly voice.
&#8220;I want money, and I&#8217;m going to have it. Good
old Chi is range enough for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I can&#8217;t give you two thousand because
I haven&#8217;t got it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you got?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Five hundred dollars, the pay of my herders.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take that on account, then,&#8221; said Caldwell
insolently. &#8220;When will you have some more?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not until the end of July, when the wool has
been shipped East.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. I&#8217;ll wait till then. Come on,
hand over the five hundred.&#8221;</p>
<p>Larkin reached inside his heavy woolen shirt,
opened a chamois bag that hung by a string around
his neck, and emptied it of bills. These he passed
to Caldwell without a word.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are wise, Smithy,&#8221; he said in an even
voice, &#8220;you won&#8217;t ask me for any more. I&#8217;ve
about reached the end of my rope in this business.
And let me tell you that this account between
you and me is going to be settled in full to
my credit before very long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe and maybe not,&#8221; said the other insolently,
and walked off.</p>
<p>Five minutes later Bud Larkin, sick at heart
that this skeleton of the past had risen up to confront
him in his new life, made his way around
the ranch house to the front entrance. Just as he
was going in at the door a man appeared from the
opposite side so that the two met. The other
skulked back and disappeared, but in that moment
Bud recognized the figure of Stelton, and a sudden
chill clutched his heart.</p>
<p>Had the foreman of the Bar T been listening
and heard all?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span></p>
<p>Entering the living-room, where the Bissells
were already gathered, Larkin expected to find
Caldwell, but inquiry elicited the fact that he had
not been seen. Five minutes later the drumming
of a pony&#8217;s feet on the hard ground supplied the
solution of his non-appearance. Having satisfactorily
interviewed Larkin, he had mounted his
horse, which all this time had been tethered to the
corral, and ridden away.</p>
<p>Half an hour later Stelton came in, his brow
dark, and seated himself in a far corner of the
room. From his manner it was evident that he
had something to say, and Bissell drew him out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Red came in from over by Sioux Creek to-night,&#8221;
admitted the foreman, &#8220;and he says as
how the rustlers have been busy that-a-way ag&#8217;in.
First thing he saw was the tracks of their hosses,
and then, when he counted the herd, found it was
twenty head short. I&#8217;m shore put out about them
rustlers, chief, and if something ain&#8217;t done about
it pretty soon you won&#8217;t have enough prime beef
to make a decent drive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instantly the face of Bissell lost all its kindliness
and grew as dark and forbidding as Stelton&#8217;s.
Springing out of his chair, he paced up and down
the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;That has got to stop!&#8221; he said determinedly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
Then, in answer to a question of Larkin&#8217;s: &#8220;Yes,
rustlers were never so bad as they are now. It&#8217;s
got so in this State that the thieves have got more
cows among &#8217;em than the regular cowmen. An&#8217;
that ain&#8217;t all. They&#8217;ve got an organization that
we can&#8217;t touch. We&#8217;re plumb locoed with their
devilment. That&#8217;s the second bunch cut out of
that herd, ain&#8217;t it, Mike?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beef Bissell, his eyes flashing the fire that had
made him feared in the earlier, rougher days of
the range, finally stopped at the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on out with me and talk to Red,&#8221; he
ordered his foreman, and the latter, whose eyes
had never left Juliet since he entered the room,
reluctantly obeyed.</p>
<p>Presently Mrs. Bissell took herself off, and Bud
and the girl were left alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you&#8217;ll marry some time,&#8221; said Larkin,
after a long pause.</p>
<p>&#8220;I sincerely hope so,&#8221; was her laughing rejoinder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any candidates at present?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not that I know of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I know of a very active one&mdash;he just
left the room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who, Mike? Bud, that&#8217;s preposterous!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
I&#8217;ve known him ever since I was a little girl, and
would no more think of marriage with him than of
keeping pet rattlesnakes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps not, Julie, but Mike would. Will
you take the word of an absolutely disinterested
observer that the man is almost mad about you,
and would sell his soul for one of your smiles?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl was evidently impressed by the seriousness
of his tone, for she pondered a minute in silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you are right, Bud,&#8221; she said at last.
&#8220;I had never thought of it that way. But you
needn&#8217;t worry; I can take care of myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure of it, but that doesn&#8217;t make him any
the less dangerous. Keep your eye on him, and
if you ever find yourself in a place where you need
somebody bad and quick, send for me. He hates
me already, and I can&#8217;t say I love him any too
well; I have an idea that he and I will come to
closer quarters than will be good for the health of
one of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense, Bud; your imagination seems
rather lively to-night. Now, just because I am
curious, will you tell me why you went into the
sheep business?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly. Because it is the future business
of Wyoming and Montana. Sheep can live on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
less and under conditions that would kill cows.
Moreover, they are a source of double profit, both
for their wool and their mutton. The final struggle
of the range will be between sheep and cattle
and irrigation, and irrigation will win.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the sheep will drive the cattle off the
range, and, when they, in turn, are driven off, will
continue to thrive in the foothills and lower mountains,
where there is no irrigation. I went into
the sheep business to make money, but I won&#8217;t see
much of that money for several years. When I
am getting rich, cowmen like your father will be
fighting for the maintenance of a few little herds
that have not been pushed off the range by the
sheep. Cattle offer more immediate profit, but,
according to my view, they are doomed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bud, that&#8217;s the best defense of wool-growing
I ever heard,&#8221; cried the girl. &#8220;Up to this I&#8217;ve
held it against you that you were a sheepman&mdash;a
silly prejudice, of course, that I have grown up
with&mdash;but now you can consider yourself free of
that. I believe you have hit the nail on the head.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks, I believe I have,&#8221; said Bud dryly,
and a little while later they separated for the
night, but not before he had remarked:</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it would benefit all of us if you drilled
some of that common-sense into your father.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>THE SIX PISTOL SHOTS</h3>
</div>

<p>The next morning, after breakfast, which
shortly followed the rising of the sun, Bissell
called Bud Larkin aside just as that young
man had headed for the corral to rope and saddle
Pinte.</p>
<p>Gone was any hint of the man of the night before.
His red face was sober, and his brown
eyes looked into Bud&#8217;s steel-gray ones with a
piercing, almost menacing, intensity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope any friend of Julie&#8217;s will continue to
be my friend,&#8221; was all he said, but the glance and
manner attending this delicate hint left no doubt
as to his meaning. His whole attitude spelled
&#8220;sheep!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That depends entirely upon you, Mr. Bissell,&#8221;
was Larkin&#8217;s rejoinder.</p>
<p>The cowman turned away without any further
words, and Bud continued on to the corral. At
the enclosure he found Stelton roping a wiry and
vicious calico pony, and when he had finally cinched
the saddle on Pinte, he turned to see Julie at his
side.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You had better invite me to ride a little way
with you,&#8221; she said, laughing, &#8220;because I am coming
anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless you! What a treat!&#8221; cried Bud happily,
and helped to cinch up the calico, who
squealed at every tug.</p>
<p>Stelton, his dark face flushed to the color of
mahogany, sullenly left him the privilege and
walked away.</p>
<p>Presently they mounted, and Bud, with a loud
&#8220;So-long&#8221; and a wave of the hand to some of
the punchers, turned south. Julie, loping beside
him, looked up curiously at this.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you were going north, Bud,&#8221; she
cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Changed my plans overnight,&#8221; he replied non-committally,
and she did not press the subject further,
feeling, with a woman&#8217;s intuition, that war
was in the air.</p>
<p>Ten miles south, at the ford of the southern
branch of Grass Creek, she drew up her horse as
the signal for their separation, and faced north.
Bud, still headed southward, put Pinte alongside
of her and took her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a blessing to see you, you&#8217;re so
civilized,&#8221; she said, half-seriously. &#8220;Do come
again.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then you do sometimes miss the things you
have been educated to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Bud, I do, but not often. Seeing you
has brought back a flood of memories that I am
happier without.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that is what you have done for me, dear
girl,&#8221; he said in a low tone as he pressed her hand.
The next moment, with a nonchalant &#8220;So-long,&#8221;
the parting of the plains, he had dug the spurs
into his horse and ridden away.</p>
<p>For a minute the girl sat looking after this one
link between her desolate existence and the luxury
and society he still represented in her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;His manners have changed for the worse,&#8221; she
thought, recalling his abrupt departure, &#8220;but I
think he has changed for the better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which remark proves that her sense of relative
masculine values was still sound.</p>
<p>Larkin continued on directly south-east for
twenty miles, until he crossed the Big Horn at
what is now the town of Kirby. Thence his course
lay south rather than east until he should raise
the white dust of his first flock.</p>
<p>With regard to his sheep, Larkin, in all disputed
cases, took the advice of his chief herder, Hard-winter
Sims, the laziest man on the range, and
yet one who seemed to divine the numbed sheep
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
intelligence in a manner little short of marvelous.</p>
<p>Sims he had picked up in Montana, when that
individual, unable to perform the arduous duties of
a cowboy, had applied for a job as a sheep-herder&mdash;not
so much because he liked the sheep, but because
he had to eat and clothe himself. By one
of those rare accidents of luck Sims at last found
his <i>métier</i>, and Larkin the prince of sheepmen.</p>
<p>When Bud had determined to &#8220;walk&#8221; ten
thousand animals north, Sims had accompanied
him to help in the buying, and was now superintending
the long drive.</p>
<p>On his advice the drive had been divided into
five herds of two thousand, he contending that it
was dangerous, as well as injurious to the sheep, to
keep more than that number together. The
others were following at intervals of a few days.
Larkin had left the leaders just north of the hills
that formed the hooked southern end of the Big
Horn Mountains, and expected that in two days&#8217;
time they would have come north almost to the
junction of Kirby Creek and the Big Horn, near
where it was calculated to cross them.</p>
<p>After grazing his horse for an hour at noon,
and taking a bite to eat himself, Larkin pushed
on, and, in a short time, made out a faint, whitish
mist rising against the horizon of hills. It was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
the dust of his leaders. Presently, in the far distance,
a man appeared on horseback making toward
him, and Bud wondered if anything had
happened.</p>
<p>His fears were partially justified when he discovered
the horseman to be Sims, and were entirely
confirmed when he had conversed with the
herder.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve sure got to get them sheep to water,
and that mighty quick,&#8221; was the latter&#8217;s laconic
announcement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense! There&#8217;s plenty of water. What&#8217;s
the matter with &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ten miles out of the hills we found a water-hole,
but the cattle had been there first, and the
sheep wouldn&#8217;t look at it. At the camp last night
there was another hole, but some imp had deviled
the herd an&#8217; they lay alongside the water, dyin&#8217;
of thirst, but they wouldn&#8217;t drink. We pushed
&#8217;em in an&#8217; they swam around; we half-drowned
some of &#8217;em, but still they wouldn&#8217;t drink.</p>
<p>&#8220;So we made a night march without finding
water, and we haven&#8217;t found any to-day. They&#8217;re
gettin&#8217; frantic now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bud quirted the tired Pinte into a gallop, and
they approached the herd, about which the dark,
slim figures of the dogs were running. From the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
distance the first sound was the ceaseless blethering
of the flock that proclaimed its misery. The
next was the musical tinkling of the bells the
leaders wore.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reckon they&#8217;ve found another hole,&#8221; said
Sims. &#8220;Thought I seen one when I was ridin&#8217;
out.&#8221;</p>
<p>On nearer approach it was seen that the herd
was &#8220;milling,&#8221; that is, revolving in a great circle,
with a number of inner circles, half smothered in
the dust they raised, without aim or knowledge of
what they did, or why. About the herd at various
points stood the half-dozen shepherds, their
long crooks in their hands. Whenever a blatting
animal made a dash for liberty the dogs drove it
into the press, barking and nipping.</p>
<p>Larkin rode to a tall, dark-skinned shepherd,
a Basque from the California herding.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, Pedro?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;What is
the matter with them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only the good God can tell. The leaders
they take fright at something, I do not know, and
we &#8217;mill&#8217; them before any damage is done.&#8221;</p>
<p>Larkin rode around the trampling, bawling mass
to the rear, where were the cook wagon and a
couple of spare horses. He at once dismounted
and changed his uncomfortable riding-boots for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
the brogans of the herder. Pinte he relegated to
the string, for the use of a horse with sheep is
ludicrous, since the dogs are the real herders,
and obey the orders given by the uplifted arms of
the men.</p>
<p>When he rejoined Sims, the sheep had become
calmer. The flock-mind, localized in the
leaders, had come to the conclusion that, after all,
there was nothing to fear, and the circling motion
was gradually becoming slower and slower.
In a quarter of an hour comparative quiet had
been restored, and Sims gave the order to get the
flock under way. Since they had not come upon
water at this place, as the herder had hoped, it
was necessary to continue the merciless drive until
they found it.</p>
<p>Immediately the dogs cut into the dirty-white
revolving mass (the smell of which is like no other
in the world), and headed the leaders north. But
the leaders and tail-enders were inextricably
mixed, and for a long time there was great confusion.</p>
<p>Sheep on the march have one invariable position,
either among the leaders, middlers or tailers,
and until each animal has found his exact post,
nothing whatever can be done with him.</p>
<p>Until night fell the animals fed on the dry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
bunch-grass, and then, under the trotting of the
dogs, took position on the brow of a rising hill,
as though bedding down for the night. But all
did not rest, for perhaps fifty remained standing
in the perpetual flock-watch.</p>
<p>In an hour these would lie down and others take
their places, but all through the night, and at any
time when the flock rested, this hereditary protection
would become operative&mdash;seemingly a
survival of a day when neither man nor dog had
assumed this duty.</p>
<p>The cook dug his trench, built his fire and set
his folding table out under the pale sky that was
just commencing to show brilliant stars. After
the last cup of steaming coffee had been downed
and pipes lighted, Sims gave the order to march.
The herd was nearly still now, and roused with
much complaining, but the dogs were inexorable,
and presently the two thousand were shuffling on,
feeding now and then, but making good progress.</p>
<p>There was but one thing left to do in the present
instance&mdash;find running water, for it was certain
that all the springs on the plain would have been
visited by cattle, and that, therefore, the sheep
would stand by and idly perish of thirst.</p>
<p>Sims knew his country, and directed the flock
toward a shallow, rocky ford of the Big Horn,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
some five miles distant. In the meantime Bud
Larkin was facing two alternatives, either one disastrous.
The crossing of the Big Horn meant a
declaration of war to the Bar T ranch, for in
the loose division of the free country, the Bar T
range extended south to the river.</p>
<p>On the other hand, should he turn the herds
east along the bank of the Big Horn, it would be
impossible to continue the march long in that direction,
since the higher mountains were directly
ahead, and the way through them was devious,
and attended with many difficulties and dangers.
On such a drive the losses to him in time and
strayed sheep would be disastrous.</p>
<p>Larkin had no desire to clash with the cattlemen
unless it were absolutely necessary, but he decided
that his sheep should go through, since the
free range was his as well as another&#8217;s. On that
long night march, when the men were behind the
sheep, driving them, contrary to the usual custom,
he told Sims of his interview with Beef Bissell,
and the herder cracked his knuckles with
rage at the position taken by the cowman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Send &#8217;em through, Mr. Larkin,&#8221; he advised,
&#8220;and if the Bar T outfit start anything I allow
we&#8217;ll return &#8217;em as good as they give.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was within an hour of dawn when the leaders
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
of the flock lifted their heads and gazed curiously
at the line of trees that loomed before them along
the banks of the river. The next instant they had
started forward on a run, blethering the news of
water back along the dim, heaving line. The
dust beneath their sharp feet rose up into a pall
that hid the sky as the whole flock got into motion.</p>
<p>Then dogs and men leaped forward, for now
the blind singleness of purpose that pervaded the
animals was more disastrous than when they refused
to drink. Working madly, the dogs spread
out the following herd so that all should not crowd
upon the same point of the river and drown the
leaders.</p>
<p>It was unavoidable that some should be lost by
being pushed into the deeper waters north or south
of the ford, but for the most part the watering
was successfully accomplished, and at the first glow
of dawn the animals were contentedly cropping
the rich grasses in the low bottoms near the river.</p>
<p>But the work was not yet finished.</p>
<p>When it had become light enough to see, the
leaders were rounded up at the ford, and, nipped
into frenzy by the dogs, began the passage across
the shallow bar. With the leaders safely over it
was only a matter of time until the rest had followed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
and by the time it was full day the last
of the tailers were feeding in the opposite bottoms.</p>
<p>For Bud Larkin this was a very serious dawn.
He had cast the die for war and led the invasion
into the enemy&#8217;s country. Any hope that the act
might remain unknown was shattered before the
sheep had fairly forded the stream. Against the
brightening sky, on a distant rise of ground, had
appeared the silent figure of a horse and man, one
of the Bar T range riders.</p>
<p>Six distant, warning pistol shots had rung out,
and then the horse and rider had disappeared
across the plain at a headlong gallop.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>STRATEGY AND A SURPRISE</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Gub pi-i-i-le!&#8221; yelled the cook at the top
of his voice.</p>
<p>The weary herders with Sims and Larkin answered
the cry as one man, for they were spent
with the exertions of the night, and heavy-eyed
from want of sleep. The meal of mutton, camp-bread,
beans, and Spanish onions was dispatched
with the speed that usually accompanied such ceremonies,
and Sims told off the herders to watch
the flock while the others slept.</p>
<p>A general commanding soldiers would have
pressed forward, thus increasing the advantage
gained in the enemy&#8217;s country, but when sheep
compose the marching column, human desires are
the last thing consulted. After their long thirst
and forced drive it was necessary that the animals
recover their strength for a day amid abundant
feed and water.</p>
<p>Immediately after breakfast Larkin called a
small, close-knit herder to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you ride a horse?&#8221; he asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Si, señor</i>,&#8221; replied the man, who came originally
from the southern range.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then saddle that piebald mare and take provisions
for four days. Travel day and night
until you reach the Larkin ranch in Montana, and
give this letter to the man who is in charge
there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bud drew a penciled note from the pocket of his
shirt and handed it to the other. Then he produced
a rough map of the country he had drawn
and added it to the letter, explaining a number of
times the distances from point to point, and tracing
the route with his pencil. At last the herder
understood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell them to hurry,&#8221; was Larkin&#8217;s parting injunction,
as the other turned away to saddle the
mare.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Si, señor</i>. Hurry like blazes, eh?&#8221; said
Miguel, comprehending, with a flash of white
teeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hardly had the man galloped away north, following
the bank of the river for the better concealment
past the Bar T range, when Sims languidly
approached.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon we&#8217;re in for trouble, boss,&#8221; he remarked,
yawning sleepily, &#8220;an&#8217; I&#8217;m plumb dyin&#8217;
for rest, but I s&#8217;pose I better look over the country
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
ahead if we&#8217;re goin&#8217; to get these muttons out
o&#8217; here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was just going to suggest it,&#8221; said Larkin.
&#8220;I am going to stay by the camp and meet some
friends of mine that I expect very shortly. Come
back <i>pronto</i>, Hardy, for there&#8217;s no telling what
we may have to do before night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Larkin&#8217;s predictions of a visit were soon enough
fulfilled. It was barely ten o&#8217;clock when several
horsemen were seen riding toward the banks of
the Big Horn. Bud mounted Pinte and advanced
to meet them.</p>
<p>First came Beef Bissell, closely attended by
Stelton, and after them, four or five of the Bar T
punchers. The actual encounter took place half a
mile from the camp. Looking back, Larkin could
see his sheep feeding in plain sight amid the green
of the river bottoms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Howdy,&#8221; snapped Bissell, by way of greeting.
And then, without waiting for a reply: &#8220;What
does this mean?&#8221; He indicated the placid sheep.</p>
<p>&#8220;My flock was dying of thirst, and I brought
them up last night,&#8221; said Bud. &#8220;They crossed
the river early this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you keep them on the other side?
I warned you about this.&#8221;</p>

</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I warned you first, Mr. Bissell. My sheep
have got to go north, and the range west of the
Big Horn is the only practicable way to drive
them. They would never come through if I
started them through the mountains. You ought
to know that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind what I ought to know,&#8221; cried
Bissell angrily, his red face flaming with fury.
&#8220;There&#8217;s one thing I do know, and that is, that
those range-killers don&#8217;t go a step farther north
on my side of the river.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you can show me clear title to ownership
of this part of the range I will risk them in the
mountains; otherwise not,&#8221; replied Bud, imperturbably.
&#8220;This range is free, and as much mine
as yours. There&#8217;s no use going into this question
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the first true thing you&#8217;ve said,&#8221;
snarled the cowman. &#8220;Now, you listen here. I
don&#8217;t go hunting trouble nowhere, but there ain&#8217;t
a man between the Rio Grande and the Columbia
that can say I don&#8217;t meet it half-way when I see
it headed in my direction. Now, I&#8217;ve given you
fair warnin&#8217; before. I&#8217;ll give it to you again, but
this is the last time. Either you have them sheep
t&#8217;other side of the river by this time to-morrow,
or you take the consequences.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that your final word on the matter?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. An&#8217; I&#8217;ve got witnesses to prove that
you were given a chance to clear out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you give me only twenty-four hours?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bud&#8217;s face took on a look of discouragement
and failure, and he sat for a time as though seeking
a loophole of escape from his ultimatum. At
last he lifted his head and looked at the cowman
with a listless eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he said, hopelessly; &#8220;I&#8217;ll be gone
by that time.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, without further words, he wheeled his
horse slowly and rode back to the camp. As he
rode he maintained his dejected attitude, but his
mind was actively laying plans for the overthrow
of Bissell. Under the mask of seeming defeat he
sought to find means for an unexpected victory.</p>
<p>Though his whole being rose in revolt against
the arbitrary claims of the cattle king, he had become
so hardened to this injustice everywhere that
he no longer wasted his time or strength in vain
railings against it. Instinctively he felt that this
was to be a struggle of strength against cunning,
for the very thought of physical resistance to
thirty fighting cowboys by half a dozen herders
was ridiculous.</p>
<p>Many similar skirmishes, both on his home
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
ranch and on the trail, had sharpened Larkin&#8217;s wits
for emergencies, and it was with really no spirit of
humble complaisance that he faced the future.
Much, however, depended on the result of Sim&#8217;s
explorations.</p>
<p>By the time Larkin arrived at the camp the
visiting cowmen had disappeared. But this did
not mean for a moment that they had all returned
to the Bar T ranch house. Merely to top the first
hill would have been to see a horse with hanging
bridle, and a cow-puncher near by camped on the
trail that led to the north.</p>
<p>As fortune would have it, Sims slunk into camp
just at the dinner hour.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;d they say to yuh?&#8221; he asked abruptly.
&#8220;I seen the confab from over on that hogback
yonder.&#8221;</p>
<p>The herder&#8217;s respect for his employer sometimes
diminished to the vanishing point.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got to clear out in twenty-four hours or take
what&#8217;s comin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;d&#8217;ye tell &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I said we would.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lank herder started back in amazement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, blazes!&#8221; he grieved. &#8220;That I should&#8217;ve
ever took on with a milksop boss. I&#8217;m plumb disgraced&mdash;&#8221;
His voice trailed off into silence as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
he recognized the twinkle in Larkin&#8217;s eye. &#8220;Oh,
I see what yuh mean,&#8221; he apologized, with a wide
grin. &#8220;We&#8217;ll clear out all right. Oh, yes!
Sure!&#8221;</p>
<p>He sat down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Depends on you a good deal,&#8221; remarked
Bud, shoving the beans toward him. &#8220;What did
you find this morning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Found a new way north,&#8221; was the muffled and
laconic reply. &#8220;Yaas,&#8221; he continued presently,
after regarding his reflection in the bottom of a
tin cup that had been full of coffee the moment
before, &#8220;an&#8217; it&#8217;s over on that hogback.&#8221;</p>
<p>A &#8220;hogback,&#8221; be it understood, is a rugged
rocky mound, carved by weather erosion. It is
the result of the level rock strata of the plains suddenly
bending upward and protruding out of the
earth.</p>
<p>&#8220;That ridge runs north for about two mile,
and at the end seems to turn east into the Big
Horn foothills. So far as I can see, no man or
critter has ever been there, for there ain&#8217;t any
water in that crotch, and nothin&#8217; else but heat and
rattlers. The point of the thing is this: Spring
rains for a couple of million years have wore a
regular watercourse down that crotch, and I think
we can run the sheep over it, single file.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but won&#8217;t they be out on the open Bar
T range when we get them over?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, boss. D&#8217;ye think I&#8217;d do a thing like
that? Honest, the way you misjudge a man!
Well, across that hogback, where it turns to the
east, there is a string of range hills covered with
good feed, and leadin&#8217; north, for twenty miles.
My idea&#8217;s this:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll send Pedro with about a hundred rams and
wethers directly north from here, as they&#8217;re expecting
we will. All of them will have bells on,
and Pedro&#8217;ll have to prod &#8217;em some to make &#8217;em
bawl. While he is drawing all the trouble, we&#8217;ll
hustle the rest of the flock along behind the hogback,
over the pass, and north behind the shelter
of the hills.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine, Sims; just the thing!&#8221; exclaimed
Larkin, taking up with the idea enthusiastically.
&#8220;It will be a thundering brute of a man who won&#8217;t
let the flock north once it has gone twenty miles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I allow that perhaps the Bar T punchers will
be watchin&#8217; that hogback, although I couldn&#8217;t find
tracks there, new or old. If they ever catch the
sheep in that gully, you&#8217;re due to wish you&#8217;d stayed
East.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s our risk, and we&#8217;ve got to take it.
Now, I think we&#8217;d better roll up for a few hours
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
this afternoon, for we didn&#8217;t sleep last night, and
I don&#8217;t believe we will to-night. Have Pedro call
us at half-past four, and have him round up the
sheep about five.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sheep, because of some perverse twist in their
natures, cannot graze standing still. They must
walk slowly forward a few steps every few moments.
To-day, however, because of the luxuriant
grass along the river, the progress of the flock
had been comparatively slow. Their day&#8217;s
&#8220;walk&#8221; would bring them, Larkin figured, to a
point less than a mile distant from the hogback,
and an ideal spot from which to start the march.</p>
<p>Pedro called the two men at the appointed hour,
and they reached the flock just in time for the
bedding down. Immediately all hands went
through the sheep, removing bells from the animals
that usually wore them, and fastening them
about the necks of those delegated to act as a blind
and cover the advance of the main body.</p>
<p>To a Bar T cow-puncher who knew anything
about sheep, the evening scene would have exhibited
nothing out of the ordinary. From the
reclining hundreds came the soft bleating of ewes
calling their young, which is only heard at the
daily bedding, the low-toned blethering of the
others of the flock, and the tinkle of bells.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></p>
<p>Beside the cook wagon the fire glowed in the
trench, and everything seemed to be progressing
normally.</p>
<p>Twilight came early among the trees and brush
near the river, but it was not until absolute darkness
had descended over the vast expanse of
prairie that Larkin gave the order to march.
Then the main body of the herd, with Sims at its
head, the dogs flanking and Bud bringing up the
rear on horseback, moved silently out toward the
unknown hazards of the hogback pass.</p>
<p>Pedro and his hundred had been ordered to
wait fifteen minutes, until the head of the column
should have almost reached the shelter of the hogback.
This he did, and then headed his small
flock straight up the open prairie of the range,
amid a chorus of bells and loud-voiced protest.
Larkin, half a mile away, heard these sounds and
smiled grimly, for the flocks before him made
scarcely any sound at all.</p>
<p>In the darkness ahead he could hear the low
voices of the men talking to the dogs and encouraging
the unresponsive sheep. Overhead were
the brilliant, low-swinging stars that gave just
enough light to show him the trend of the long,
heaving line.</p>
<p>For another half-hour there was silence. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
sounds of Pedro and his flock became fainter as
the two bodies diverged from each other. Now
the dark wall of the hogback rose up on Larkin&#8217;s
left; the last of the flock was behind shelter. The
going was rough and Pinte chose each step carefully,
but the sheep made good progress, because
there was no grass to tempt them.</p>
<p>After another long space, broken only by the
clatter of hard little feet on stone, distant shots
rang out, accompanied by faint yells, and Larkin
knew that Pedro had met with the first of the Bar
T outfit.</p>
<p>The sheepman was resigned to losing the hundred,
just as cattlemen do not hesitate to cut out
and abandon all weak animals on a long drive. It
is a loss credited to the ultimate good of the business,
but Bud had not consented to this sacrifice
if it meant also the sacrifice of the herder.</p>
<p>Pedro had, however, with many winks and glintings
of teeth, made it clear that he did not expect to
depart this life yet a while, hinting mysteriously at
certain charms, amulets and saints that made it a
business to keep him among the living.</p>
<p>Pedro, to Bud&#8217;s knowledge, had been in numerous
seamy affairs before, and had always reappeared,
rather the worse for wear, but perfectly
sound in all respects. He did not doubt but what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
the Spaniard would turn up at the cook wagon for
breakfast.</p>
<p>The sounds of distant conflict continued for perhaps
five or ten minutes, at the end of which time
perfect silence reigned again. Larkin wondered
how many of the animals had been killed, or
whether they had been merely scattered&mdash;the
equivalent of death, for a sheep is unable to find
water, and if frightened, will back against a face
of rock and starve to death.</p>
<p>Another half-hour passed, and now Larkin could
see the dim white backs of the herd rising before
him as they climbed the steep watercourse. He
judged that more than half the flock must be down
the precipitous other side, and his heart beat with
exultation at the success of Sim&#8217;s strategy. The
plan was to hide the sheep in some little green
valley during the day and march them at night until
discovered or until the upper range was reached.</p>
<p>Suddenly, just as the last of the flock was mounting
the ascent, Larkin drew Pinte up short and listened
intently. Then he quickly dismounted and
placed his ear to the ground only to leap into the
saddle again, swing his horse quickly and ride
back along the trail.</p>
<p>He had heard the unmistakable pounding of
feet, and an instant&#8217;s sickening fear flashed before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
him the possibility that the Bar T cowboys had discovered
the ruse after all; either that or they had
extorted the secret of it from Pedro.</p>
<p>Larkin loosened the pistol in his holster, one
of those big, single-action wooden-handled forty-fives
that have settled so many unrecorded disputes,
and prepared to cover the rear of the herd
until it had safely crossed the hogback.</p>
<p>Pinte&#8217;s ears twitched forward. The sound of
galloping feet was nearer now. Larkin clapped
on spurs and trotted to meet it.</p>
<p>Closer and closer it came, a mingled clatter of
hoofs. Then suddenly there rang out the frightened
bawl of a bewildered calf.</p>
<p>The aspects of the situation took on another
hue. If these had been cattle stampeded by the
shots and shouting on the plain, they would have
made a vastly different thundering along the earth.
Cattle never ran this way by themselves; therefore
the obvious inference was that they were
driven.</p>
<p>Again, the Bar T punchers had no call to drive
cattle at night, particularly this night. Who,
then, was driving them? In an instant Larkin&#8217;s
mind had leaped these various steps of reasoning
and recalled old Beef Bissell&#8217;s vehement arraignment
of rustlers in the State. The answer was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
plain. The calves were being driven off the range
into concealment by cattle-thieves.</p>
<p>Larkin knew that all the sheep had not yet
passed the top of the hogback. It was absolutely
necessary that their passage be unknown and unobserved.
There was but one thing to do.</p>
<p>Spurring his horse, he charged toward the oncoming
animals, whose dark forms he could now
discern a hundred yards away. As he rode, he
shouted and drew his revolver, firing into their
faces. When at last it seemed that he must come
into violent collision with them, they turned, snorting,
to the east and made off in the direction of the
river.</p>
<p>His purpose accomplished, Larkin wheeled
Pinte sharply and dug in his spurs, but at that instant
two dark forms loomed close, one on each
side, and seized the bridle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hands up!&#8221; said a gruff voice. &#8220;You&#8217;re
covered.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>UGLY COMPANY</h3>
</div>

<p>Larkin&#8217;s revolver was empty, and his hands
mechanically went up.</p>
<p>The captor on his right relieved him of the useless
weapon, and, in a trice, produced a rope, with
which he bound the sheepman&#8217;s arms tightly behind
him. With the other end of the rope turned
about the pommel of his saddle, he dropped back
into the darkness, while his companion rode to a
position ahead of Larkin.</p>
<p>At a growled word from behind, the little cavalcade
advanced, Larkin mystified, uncertain and
fuming with impotent rage. Never in his life had
he been so needed as he was at that time by Sims
and the herdsmen; never in his life had he so
ardently desired liberty and freedom of action.</p>
<p>Why these men had captured him he did not
know; what they intended doing with him he had
no idea&mdash;although his knowledge of plainsmen&#8217;s
character supplied him with two or three solutions
hardly calculated to exhilarate the victim.
Where they were taking him was almost as much
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
of a puzzle, for Bud, after the first few turns of
his captors, completely lost his sense of direction,
except for the general compass of the stars.</p>
<p>No longer the friendly loom of the hogback
was on his left. He felt the free wind of the
plains on his face, and calculated that they must
have returned to the open range.</p>
<p>Who his captors were was another puzzle. If
these men had been driving the cattle why did
they not continue to drive them instead of turning
aside to make prisoner a harmless sheepman? If
they were not driving the cattle&mdash;</p>
<p>A horrible suspicion crossed Bud&#8217;s mind. If
these were punchers from the Bar T outfit he was
indeed in a bad way, for no one knew better than
Larkin (by hearsay) the wild stories told of Beef
Bissell&#8217;s methods in a cattle war.</p>
<p>The young man told himself calmly that if he
got away with a few head of sheep and an entire
body he would consider himself fortunate in the
extreme.</p>
<p>For seemingly endless ages the leader trotted
on ahead&mdash;so far, in fact, did he ride that Larkin&#8217;s
arms and elbow joints were racked with pain
from being held so long in an unnatural position.
At the end of what was probably three hours, a
small fiery glow made itself evident at some distance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
across the plain, and the sheepman knew by
this camp-fire that the goal of his ride was in sight.</p>
<p>A solitary man sat by the fire, rolling and smoking
a continuous stream of cigarettes. Dimly
seen in the near-by shadows were the long figures
of other men rolled in their blankets. Bud knew
that not far off the hobbled horses grazed, or had
lain down to rest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kick up the boys, Bill,&#8221; said the man who
held the rope. &#8220;Got somethin&#8217; queer to look
into this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, let &#8217;em sleep, chief,&#8221; drawled Bill without
moving. &#8220;Some of &#8217;em ain&#8217;t closed their eyes
in nigh on three days. What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Got a young captain here who &#8217;lows he&#8217;s some
brave man, I reckon. Leastways he come drivin&#8217;
at us with fire a-poppin&#8217; out of his gun, an&#8217; Shorty
and me thinks we better investigate. So we nabs
him when his gun&#8217;s empty and brings him in. A
man that&#8217;ll shoot around reckless the way this
feller did is plumb dangerous to have runnin&#8217;
loose.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I guess you&#8217;re right about the boys, Bill.
I&#8217;ll let &#8217;em sleep an&#8217; we&#8217;ll talk to this maverick in
the mornin&#8217;. Keep him under your eye.&#8221;</p>
<p>Things were clearing up for Larkin. These
men evidently thought that he was some ambitious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
puncher on the lookout for rustlers. Up to this
time he had kept silent, borrowing no trouble and
trusting to his ability to identify himself. But
now at the prospect of idling here all night and
part of the day he protested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Turn my arms loose, will you?&#8221; he demanded.
&#8220;They&#8217;re about broke off.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joe, the chief, after carefully searching him for
additional weapons, complied with his request, in
so far that he bound his wrists together in front.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, boys,&#8221; said Bud, crisply, &#8220;I wish you&#8217;d
tell me what this all means. If you want to
question me, do it now and let me go, for I&#8217;ve
got mighty important business up the line a
way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I allow yuh have,&#8221; remarked Joe, dryly.
&#8220;Yuh also got some mighty important business
right here, if yuh only knowed it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fannin&#8217; yore gun at us that-a-way. Yore
plumb careless, young feller. But look here, I&#8217;m
not a-goin&#8217; to stay up all night talkin&#8217; to yuh.
You&#8217;ll have to talk to all the boys in the mornin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t wait till morning, I tell you,&#8221; cried
Bud, exasperated. &#8220;Every minute I sit here I
may be losing thousands of dollars. For Heaven&#8217;s
sake let me go to-night, and I&#8217;ll come back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
any other time you say. I give you my word for
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t wait till to-morrer! Stranger, you may
wait till the crack o&#8217; doom before you ever get
back to that business o&#8217; yourn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221; asked Larkin,
made strangely ill at ease by some veiled meaning
in the other&#8217;s tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got to leave it to the boys,&#8221; was Joe&#8217;s evasive
reply. &#8220;Better lay down and git some sleep;
likely to be busy all day to-morrer.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Larkin, finding that all argument was as
futile as trying to crack Gibraltar with a cold chisel,
relapsed into silence, and prepared to get what
rest he could until daylight.</p>
<p>Morning disclosed the fact that the group of
men numbered about ten, each with a horse near
by, and all fully supplied with arms. In fact,
there was not a man among them who could not
have &#8220;rolled a gun&#8221; with both hands if necessary,
and at the same time carried a knife between his
teeth. This matter of complete armament, together
with Joe&#8217;s ambiguous speeches of the night
before, wholly convinced Larkin that he had fallen
in with a band of rustlers.</p>
<p>Breakfast was prepared for himself by each
man, Joe attending to the wants of the prisoner,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
but no attempt was made to rope or saddle the
horses. They were evidently waiting for something.
What this was became evident shortly
when another group of five men appeared around
a distant rise and loped to the rendezvous. Larkin
reasoned that these must be the men who continued
the cattle drive after Joe and Pike had captured
him.</p>
<p>The sheepman could not but admire the natural
advantages of the place chosen by his captors for
the meeting. Rolling hills surrounded the little
pocket on all sides, and here and there a red scoria
butte thrust its ugly height out of the plain. The
chances of discovery were infinitesimal.</p>
<p>The evolution of the rustler was logical but
rapid, and started with the general law that any
ranch-owner was at liberty to brand with his mark
any maverick found on his range. As it was the
cowboy who discovered these strays, he was
usually provided with a branding-iron and put the
seal of his employer on the animal wherever
found.</p>
<p>From this it was but a step for unscrupulous
punchers, or those with a shrewd eye for business,
to drive off unbranded cattle and ship them independently
to market, or to mark them with a
private brand of their own. All this was before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
the introduction of brand inspectors at the stockyards
of Omaha, Kansas City, or Chicago.</p>
<p>Therefore, among the men at this rendezvous
Larkin noted types of cowmen equal to any on the
range for horsemanship and ability to handle
cattle. With his naturally quick eye, the sheepman
observed them closely, but failed to recognize
any of them.</p>
<p>His case came up quickly.</p>
<p>By various papers in his possession he proved
his identity.</p>
<p>&#8220;What were you doing out on the range last
night?&#8221; asked Joe.</p>
<p>Bud hesitated for a minute and then, deciding
that his safest and quickest course would be to
make a clean breast of things, replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;I was driving two thousand head of sheep
north on the Bar T.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;re not a cattleman?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; Larkin produced his bills of sale for
the sheep and these were handed gravely about
from one to another, although it was certain
that some of the men could not read them.</p>
<p>&#8220;How long are you going to stay in this country?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as long as it takes to get my sheep north.
I come from Montana.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></p>
<p>Joe beckoned a number of the men aside out
of Larkin&#8217;s hearing.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re plumb lucky,&#8221; he announced. &#8220;If I
know my book, old Bissell will forget all about a
few missin&#8217; calves when he knows this feller has
sent sheep up his range. Now we&#8217;ve got to run
off about a hundred more head to that railroad
camp north of here, and I think we can use this
Larkin.&#8221;</p>
<p>A dark, sullen-looking puncher shook his head
slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s takin&#8217; chances,&#8221; he growled. &#8220;String
him up, I say. He knows us all now, and I&#8217;d
sooner he&#8217;d look through a rope than me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You shore are ornery, Pete,&#8221; said a third,
&#8220;an&#8217; plumb set on stretchin&#8217; yore neck. Cain&#8217;t
yuh see that if yuh hang this feller we&#8217;ll have both
the sheep and cattlemen ag&#8217;in us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shore, that&#8217;s sense,&#8221; broke in another. &#8220;Less
hear Joe&#8217;s scheme.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t so blame much, boys,&#8221; countered the
chief modestly. &#8220;We&#8217;ll make this Larkin swear
never to give word agin us if we don&#8217;t kill him.
Then we&#8217;ll run him off into the hills for four or
five days with a guard, finish our own drive, and
clear out, lettin&#8217; him go. What d&#8217;ye think of
that?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a reg&#8217;lar hum-dinger, Joe,&#8221; said one man,
and the others concurred in the laudatory
opinion.</p>
<p>But at the first sentence to Larkin, that young
man upset their well-laid plans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Larkin,&#8221; said Joe, &#8220;we allow as how we&#8217;d
like to make a bargain with yuh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are going to bargain with me to break
the law, you had better not say anything about it,&#8221;
was the reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was jest about startin&#8217; one of them mutual
protective, benefit and literary sassieties,&#8221; suggested
Joe tactfully as a feeler, while his comrades
grinned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t want to hear about it,&#8221; retorted Bud,
divining the intention. &#8220;You can do anything
you like with me, but don&#8217;t tell me your bargains.
I&#8217;ve got troubles enough with my sheep without
signing on any more. Now, look here, men, I
don&#8217;t want to interfere with you, and it only wastes
your time to bother with me. Suppose you let me
go about my business and you go about yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Swear on oath never to recognize or bear witness
against us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. What kind of a crook do you think I
am? If I were put under oath by a sheriff, I
would have to accuse you, and I&#8217;d do it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></p>
<p>Joe Parker&#8217;s face lost its expression of genial
amiability and he looked about on a circle of dark
countenances.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m plumb sorry you act this-a-way,&#8221; he said
aggrievedly. &#8220;Boys, where&#8217;s the nearest tree?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ten miles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;After dinner everybody saddle up,&#8221; came the
order.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>PRAIRIE BELL</h3>
</div>

<p>When Juliet Bissell rode back to the Bar
T ranch after her parting with Larkin at
the fork of Grass Creek, she was a decidedly more
thoughtful and sober young woman than she had
been at the same hour the day previous.</p>
<p>Although blessed with an adoring father and
a rather eccentric mother, she had, for the last
year, begun to feel the stirrings of a tiny discontent.</p>
<p>Her life was a good example of the familiar
mistake made by many a wealthy cattle-owner.
Her parents, realizing their crudity and lack of
education, had seen to it that she should be given
all the advantages denied them, and had sent her
East to Chicago for eight consecutive years.</p>
<p>During this time, while hating the noise and
confinement of the city, she had absorbed much of
its glamour, and enjoyed its alluring pleasures with
a keen appreciation. Music had been her chief
study, and her very decided talent had opened a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
busy career for her had she chosen to follow
it.</p>
<p>But Julie was true to her best instincts, and
refused to consider such a thing. Her father and
mother had done all in their power for her, she
reasoned, and therefore it was but fair that she
should return to them and make the closing years
of their lives happy.</p>
<p>Though nothing had ever been said, the girl
knew that when she had left the ranch house,
even for a week&#8217;s visit with a girl friend two hundred
miles away, the sun might as well have fallen
from the heavens, considering the gloom that descended
upon the Bar T.</p>
<p>It was this knowledge of their need for her that
had brought her back to fulfill what she considered
her greatest happiness and duty in life.</p>
<p>Now, a monkey cannot wear clothes, smoke
cigarettes, perform before applauding audiences
and return to the jungle without a certain feeling
of hateful unfitness among his gibbering brethren.</p>
<p>No more could this wild, lovely creature of the
plains become one of the most sought-after girls
of Chicago&#8217;s North Shore set, and return to the
painful prose of the Bar T ranch without paying
the penalty.</p>
<p>With the glory of health and outdoor life, she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
had failed to realize this, but since the sudden
appearance of Bud Larkin she had done little else.</p>
<p>He had brought back to her a sudden powerful
nostalgia for the life she had once known.
And had old Beef Bissell been aware of this nostalgia,
he would have realized for the first time
that in his desire to give his daughter everything
he had created a situation that was already unfortunate
and might, with very little prompting, be
unhappy.</p>
<p>But this knowledge was not vouchsafed to him,
and Julie certainly would never make it plain.</p>
<p>The evening after Bud&#8217;s departure, that same
evening, in fact, when he was fighting toward water
with his flocks, the cattleman and his daughter
sat outside on the little veranda that ran across
the front of the ranch house.</p>
<p>&#8220;That feller Larkin,&#8221; remarked Bissell, terminating
a long pause. &#8220;Kind of a dude or something
back East, wasn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what the punchers would call him, father,&#8221;
returned the girl gravely. &#8220;But he was
never anything but a gentleman in his treatment of
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you mean exactly by that
word &#8217;gentleman,&#8217; Julie, but I allow that no real
man ever went into raisin&#8217; sheep.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps not, dear,&#8221; she said, taking his rough,
ungainly hand in both of hers, &#8220;but I think there
is bound to be money in it. Mr. Larkin himself
says that in the end the cattle will have to give
way before the sheep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; he thought he was tellin&#8217; you something
new when he said it, too, didn&#8217;t he? Well, I&#8217;ve
knowed that fact for the last five years. That&#8217;s
the main reason I won&#8217;t let his animals through
my range. Once they get a foothold, there&#8217;s no
stoppin&#8217; &#8217;em. Judas! I&#8217;m tired of fightin&#8217; for
things!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor father,&#8221; and the girl&#8217;s voice was full of
tenderness. &#8220;You&#8217;re not discouraged, are you,
dear?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Prairie Bell, but I reckon I&#8217;m gettin&#8217; old,
an&#8217; I can&#8217;t get up the fight I used to. I thought
I had my hands full with the rustlers, but now
with the sheep comin&#8217;&mdash;well, between you and
me, little girl, I wish I had somebody to stand up
and take the licks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Mike; he certainly can give and take
a few.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, of course I&#8217;ve got Mike, but, when you&#8217;re
all done, he&#8217;s only a foreman, an&#8217; his interest
don&#8217;t go much beyond his seventy-five a month an&#8217;
grub. Yet&mdash;by George!&#8221; He sat suddenly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
erect and slapped his thigh with his disengaged
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, nothin&#8217;.&#8221; They talked on in the affectionate,
intimate way that had always characterized
their relations since Julie had been a girl
just big enough to listen to involved harangues
about cattle without actually going to sleep. In
the course of an hour Bissell suddenly asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever think of marryin&#8217;, Prairie
Bell?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If thinking ever helped any, I would have
been a Mormon by this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you are growed up, ain&#8217;t you?&#8221; and
Bissell spoke in the wondering tone of a man
who has just realized a self-evident fact
&#8220;Fancy my little girl old enough to marry! How
old are you, anyhow? &#8217;Bout eighteen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty-five, you dear, old goose. Eighteen!
The idea.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, twenty-five, then. Of course, Julie,
when I die I will leave this place to you, and that&#8217;s
what made me think about your marryin&#8217;. I want
a good, sharp man to fight fer my cows an&#8217; my
range, a man that knows it and could make a
success of it, an&#8217; yet wouldn&#8217;t care because it was
in your name.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Would you mind if I loved him a little bit,
too?&#8221; asked the girl, with elaborately playful
sarcasm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless you, no. Love him all you want to, but
I &#8217;low you couldn&#8217;t love a man very long who
didn&#8217;t have all them qualifications I mentioned. I
figger love out somethin&#8217; like this. First there&#8217;s
a rockbed of ability, then a top soil of decency, an&#8217;
out o&#8217; these two, admiration kind o&#8217; grows like
corn. Of course you always grind up the corn
and soak it with sentiment; then you&#8217;ve got mush.
An&#8217; the trouble with most people is they only
think of the mush an&#8217; forget the rock an&#8217; the top
soil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you old philosopher!&#8221; cried the girl,
laughing and squeezing his big shoulders.
&#8220;You&#8217;re awfully clever, really.&#8221; Which remark
brought a confused but pleased blush to Bissell&#8217;s
hard face that had become wonderfully soft and
tender during this hour with his daughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, see here,&#8221; went on the girl severely, &#8220;I
think there&#8217;s something back of all this talk about
marriage. What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bissell looked at her, startled, not having expected
to encounter feminine intuition.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217;, only I wish you could marry somebody
that&#8217;d look out fer you the way I mentioned.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
Then I could die happy, though I don&#8217;t expect
to be on that list fer a long while.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anybody in mind?&#8221; asked Julie banteringly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, not exactly,&#8221; hesitated her father, with
another sharp glance. &#8220;But I allow I could dig
up one if I tried very hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go ahead and try.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now there&#8217;s Billy Speaker over on the
Circle Arrow, as gentle a man for a blond as I
ever see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve only met him twice in my life,&#8221; remarked
the girl. &#8220;Try again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Red Tarken, foreman on the M
Square. He&#8217;d be good to yuh, I know, and he&#8217;s
a hum-dinger about cows.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad he has one qualification aside from
his red hair,&#8221; put in Julie seriously. &#8220;However,
I am afraid that as a husband Red would be about
as steady as a bronco saddled for the first time
after the winter feeding. He&#8217;d better have free
range as long as he lives. Once more, father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, see here, Julie, it seems to me you could
do a lot worse than take our own Mike Stelton.
I&#8217;ve never thought of it much before, but to-night
it sort of occurred to me an&#8217;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Juliet Bissell broke into an uncontrollable fit
of laughter, at which her father fixed her with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
a regard as wondering as it was hurt. His cherished
inspiration so tactfully approached had burst
like a soap-bubble under the gale of Juliet&#8217;s merriment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bud was right, after all,&#8221; said the girl, after
her nervous outbreak. &#8220;He told me Mike had
some silly hope or other, and I believe Stelton has
given you absent treatment until you have made
this suggestion. Father, he&#8217;s just as preposterous
as the others.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t agree with you,&#8221; contended Bissell
stubbornly. &#8220;Mike is faithful, and has been for
years. He knows the ins and outs of the business,
and is willing to take the hard knocks that I&#8217;m
getting tired of. Then there&#8217;s another thing. I
could be half-blind an&#8217; still see what Mike has
been wanting these last five years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Juliet suddenly rose to her feet, all the laughter
gone from her eyes and her heart. With a feeling
of frightened helplessness she realized that
her father was serious.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you taking Mike&#8217;s part against me?&#8221; she
asked calmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I still don&#8217;t see why you couldn&#8217;t marry
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve forgotten the mush, father, but that
isn&#8217;t all. There&#8217;s something different about Mike
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
lately, something I have never noticed before.
His eye seems shifty; he avoids all the family. If
I didn&#8217;t know him so well, I should think he was
a criminal. Leaving out the fact that I don&#8217;t love
him, and that the very thought of his ever touching
me makes me shudder, this distrust of him
would be enough to block any such arrangements.
Why&#8221;&mdash;and her lip curled scornfully&mdash;&#8220;I would
marry Bud Larkin a hundred times rather than
Mike Stelton once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221;</p>
<p>Bissell rose to his feet with the quiet, amazed
exclamation. He could hardly credit his ears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marry that dirty sheepman?&#8221; he continued
in a tense, even voice. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to know what
put that crazy notion in yore head. Don&#8217;t tell
me you are in love with that dude.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I am not,&#8221; answered the girl just as
evenly, &#8220;but I may as well tell you frankly, that
he is the only man within a radius of three hundred
miles who has certain things I must have in
a husband. I&#8217;m sorry if I displease you, father!&#8221;
she cried, going to him affectionately, &#8220;but I could
never love any one not of our class.&#8221;</p>
<p>That diplomatic &#8220;our&#8221; did not deceive Bissell.
For the first time he saw that the greatest
treasure of his whole life had grown beyond
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
him; that there were needs and ideals in her
existence of which he had but the faintest inkling,
and that in her way she was as much of a &#8220;dude&#8221;
as the man she had mentioned.</p>
<p>He was encountering the seemingly cruel fate
of parents who glorify their children by their own
immolation, and who watch those same children
pass up and out of their humble range of vision
and understanding nevermore to return. Henceforth
he could never see his daughter without feeling
his own lack of polish.</p>
<p>Such a moment of realization is bitter on both
sides, but especially for the one who has given
all and can receive less in return than he had before
the giving. The iron of this bitterness entered
into Beef Bissell&#8217;s soul as he stood there,
silent, on the low, rickety veranda under the starlight
of the plains.</p>
<p>With the queer vagary of a mind at great tension,
his senses became particularly acute for a
single moment. He saw the silver-pierced vault
of the sky, smelled the fragrance of the plains
borne on the gentle wind, and heard the rustle of
the dappled cottonwoods and the howling of the
distant coyotes.</p>
<p>Then he came back to the reality of the moment,
and exhibited the simple greatness that had always
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
been his in dealings with his daughter. He
slipped his heavy arm across her shoulders and
drew her to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, Prairie Bell,&#8221; he said gently.
&#8220;You know best in everything. Do as your heart
dictates.&#8221; He sighed and added: &#8220;I wish I was
your mother to-night.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>FOR REVENGE</h3>
</div>

<p>Breakfast next morning at the Bar T
ranch was disturbed by the arrival of a cowboy
on a lathering, wicked-eyed pony who announced
to Stelton that Bud Larkin and his sheep
had crossed over into the range. What then occurred
is already known, and after Bissell had returned
from his final parley with Larkin, he retired
sullenly into himself to rage silently.</p>
<p>In his perturbed state of mind, the sheepman&#8217;s
double-edged remark about clearing out had had
but one meaning, and he took it for granted that
Larkin had been awed or frightened into the better
part of valor. This was a partial relief, but
he foresaw that although this danger to his cattle
was averted, it was merely the first of many
such struggles that he might expect.</p>
<p>Human desires, particularly those of great urgency,
are of such domination that they take little
thought for anything but themselves, except
in persons of particularly adroit mind. It was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
Stelton&#8217;s misfortune, therefore, to embark on an
ill-timed conversation with his chief.</p>
<p>The foreman for ten years had secretly adored
Juliet Bissell with all the intensity of a soul made
single of purpose by the vast, brooding immensity
of his surroundings. So long as he might be near
her, serving her in many little ways, he had been,
in a manner, content with the situation.</p>
<p>But the sudden appearance of Larkin and the
enthusiastic renewal of a former intimacy had
spurred Stelton to seek some sort of a definite understanding.
Bissell&#8217;s retirement to the veranda
after the noonday meal was shortly followed
by Stelton&#8217;s appearance there, timorous and
abashed.</p>
<p>The interview had been short and not very satisfactory.
The cowman, remembering with considerable
pain the conversation with his daughter,
told his employé frankly that he had better give
up any such ideas as evidently possessed him. Stelton,
who had with some right formerly felt he
might count on the favorable attitude of his chief,
was astounded, and took the venom of the curt refusal
to heart.</p>
<p>Retiring without betraying his emotion, he had
resolved to speak to the girl herself, and that same
afternoon asked permission to accompany her on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
her daily ride across the prairies, a thing not unusual
with him.</p>
<p>Juliet, although she wished to be alone, consented,
and at four o&#8217;clock they set out, unobserved
by Bissell.</p>
<p>It was not until they had turned their horses
homeward that Stelton spoke, almost tongue-tied
by the emotions that rent him, alternate waves of
fear and hope.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Julie,&#8221; he began, &#8220;I allow I&#8217;ve known
you a long while.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mike, you have.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I allow that I would be plumb miserable
if you ever went away from here again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Mike; I should miss you, too,&#8221;
replied the girl civilly, growing uneasy at the unusual
trend of the man&#8217;s speech, halting and indefinite
though it was.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Julie, I ain&#8217;t no hand at fine talk, but I
want to ask yuh if you will marry me? I&#8217;ve
thought about it a lot, an&#8217; though I ain&#8217;t noways
good enough fer yuh, I&#8217;d try to make yuh happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Juliet, taken aback by the suddenness of this
declaration, particularly after her talk with her father,
remained silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take yore time, Miss Julie,&#8221; pleaded Stelton,
riding closer to her. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t in no hurry.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you how much I appreciate what
you&#8217;ve said, Mike,&#8221; she replied slowly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve always
liked you and I always will, but I don&#8217;t love
you, and I would sooner tell you now than keep
you in suspense. I can&#8217;t marry you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stelton bit his lip and his dark face grew even
blacker with rage at the futility of his position.
With anyone other than Juliet Bissell, perhaps,
he realized that insistent pressure of his suit might
have favorable results. But this cool, calm girl
offered no opportunity for argument or hope.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe if yuh waited a bit, yuh might think
different about it,&#8221; he ventured nevertheless. She
shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Mike, I wouldn&#8217;t, I am sure. If you
care for me you will never mention this again.
And for my part, I shall always remember what
you have said to me to-day. It is a sweet thing
for a girl to know that a man loves her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Such gracious refusals are effective with most
men, both because they succeed in closing a tender
subject and at the same time leave an unwounded
pride. But Stelton was not the ordinary type of
lover.</p>
<p>Repressed emotions in somber minds feed and
grow fat upon their own substance, and it was inconceivable
that Stelton&#8217;s genuine though distorted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
love, an abnormal product of ten long years,
should be dismissed thus with a few words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why won&#8217;t you marry me?&#8221; he demanded,
looking angrily into her level, brown eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have told you I did not love you. That
is the reason and the best reason in the world.
Now I ask you to drop the subject.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Love somebody else, I suppose,&#8221; he sneered,
baring his teeth in a fatal attempt at an ugly
smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I do, it is none of your business,&#8221; she replied,
her eyes beginning to blaze.</p>
<p>&#8220;That dude sheepman, I allow. He&#8217;s a gilt-edged
vanderpoop, he is! But I&#8217;d hate to be in
his boots, if you want to know it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, Mike Stelton,&#8221; and Juliet drew
her horse abruptly to a stop, &#8220;either you say nothing
more on this subject or I shall tell my father
what you have done this afternoon when we reach
home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instantly the man saw he had gone too far, and,
with a quickness born of hatred, immediately
changed his front.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was only thinkin&#8217; of protectin&#8217; you,&#8221; he muttered,
&#8220;and I&#8217;m sorry I was ornery about things.
That feller Larkin is a bad lot, that&#8217;s all. He
wouldn&#8217;t be out here if he wasn&#8217;t.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></p>
<p>Perhaps it was that Juliet had given a greater
place to Larkin in her thoughts than she realized;
perhaps his eloquent defense of wool-growing had
not been sufficient explanation for his unheralded
appearance on the range. Whatever the reason,
the girl rose to the bait like a trout when the ice
has left the rivers.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221; she demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;You remember that feller Caldwell that rode
in late to supper the night Larkin come?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I heard him blackmail Larkin for five
hundred dollars back by the corral fence. An&#8217;
Larkin knew what he had to do as soon as Caldwell
showed up. Didn&#8217;t yuh see him turn yaller
at the table?&#8221;</p>
<p>As a matter of fact Larkin&#8217;s perturbation at that
time had been puzzling and inexplicable to Juliet.
Also the disappearance of the two men immediately
after supper had mystified her. But without
admitting this to Stelton she asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;What was it all about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know exactly, Miss Julie, but it worked
in somethin&#8217; he done back in Chicago a year or
so ago. From what I heard &#8217;em say, Larkin just
dodged the calaboose. Now there ain&#8217;t no disgrace
in that&mdash;that&#8217;s really credit&mdash;but that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
don&#8217;t clear him of the crime noways. Why, I
even heard &#8217;em talk about two thousand dollars
that Larkin give this Caldwell a couple of years
back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you learn all this?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was a goin&#8217; back to the corral for a rope
I left hangin&#8217; on a post there, an&#8217; I heard &#8217;em
talkin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you listened, I suppose,&#8221; remarked Julie
contemptuously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe I did,&#8221; he retorted, stung by her tone.
&#8220;But you can be thankful for it. I&#8217;d be plenty
mad if you throw&#8217;d yourself away on a man like-a-that.
A hoss that&#8217;ll kill one puncher&#8217;ll kill another.
Same with a man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you saying, Mike?&#8221; cried the girl,
frightened out of her attitude of aloof reserve.
&#8220;Kill a man! He&#8217;s never killed a man, has he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t say so in so many words, no ma&#8217;am,
but that talk o&#8217; their&#8217;n was mighty suspicious.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unwittingly Stelton had struck his hardest blow.
To him, as to other rough and ready men in the
West, life was a turbulent existence conducted with
as few hasty funerals as was absolutely necessary.
But in the girl who had absorbed the finer feelings
of a civilized community, the horror of murder
was deep-rooted.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></p>
<p>She knew that to a man in Larkin&#8217;s former position
the slightest divergence from the well-defined
tenets of right and wrong was inexcusable.
Crime, she knew, was a result of poverty, necessity,
self-defense or lack of control, and she also
knew that Bud Larkin had never been called upon
to fall back on any of these. How much of truth,
therefore, was there in Stelton&#8217;s innuendoes?</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you swear on the Bible that you overheard
what you have told me?&#8221; she asked suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am, I shore would,&#8221; Stelton answered
with solemn conviction.</p>
<p>There was no question now in her mind but
that Larkin was paying the piper for some unsavory
fling of which she had heard nothing.
She did not for a moment believe that the affair
could be as serious as Stelton wished her to imagine;
but she was sorely troubled, nevertheless, for
she had always cared for Larkin in a happy, wholehearted
way.</p>
<p>Many times since her final coming West she
had remembered with a secret tenderness and pride
that this wealthy and popular young man had been
willing to trust his life to her. It was one of the
sweetest recollections of those other far-off days.</p>
<p>Now, because the thought of Stelton&#8217;s revelations
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
was unbearable to her she resolutely put it
from her until a time when she could mourn alone
over this shattered illusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Mike, for telling me this,&#8221; she
said gently. &#8220;Please never say anything further
about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Stelton, elated that his plan of revenge had
worked so well, smiled with satisfaction and relapsed
into silence during the remainder of the ride
home.</p>
<p>All of these events are set down here with some
pretense at detail to indicate the important trend
of affairs after Larkin had said a more-or-less
indifferent good-by to Juliet Bissell at the fork of
Grass Creek. While he was wrestling with material
problems, these others that destiny had suddenly
joined to him were undergoing mental disturbances
in which he was the principal though
unconscious factor. And this unconscious prominence
was to be the main reason for what next
occurred.</p>
<p>It was perhaps noon of the day following Larkin&#8217;s
capture by the rustlers, when from a point
directly east of the ranch house a cowboy appeared,
riding at a hard gallop. Contrary to most fictions,
cowboys rarely ever urge their ponies beyond
a trot, the only occasions being the round-up,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
the stampede, the drive, or when something
serious has occurred.</p>
<p>Mike Stelton saw the puncher from a distance
and walked to the corral to meet him. Jerking
his pony back on his haunches, the rider leaped
from his back before the animal had fairly come
to a stop.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mike, we&#8217;ve been tricked!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;That
whole two thousand head of sheep are tracking
north as fast as they can go far over east on the
range, beyond the hills.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; cried the foreman, hardly able to
credit his ears. &#8220;The boys down on watch at
the Big Horn swore they had scattered the flock
last night when Larkin started to run them north
on the range.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they swore wrong, then, for I&#8217;ve just
come from where I seen &#8217;em. I was over back
of them hogbacks and buttes lookin&#8217; for strays
and mavericks when along come them muttons in
a cloud of dust that would choke a cow. I allow
that darned sheepman has made us look like
a lot of tenderfeet, Mike.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stelton at this intelligence fairly gagged on his
own fury. Larkin had scored on him again.
The two were joined at this moment by Bissell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
who had noted the excitement at the corral.
When apprised of what had happened, the cowman&#8217;s
face went as dark with anger as that of his
foreman.</p>
<p>Beef Bissell was not accustomed to the sensation
of being outwitted in anything, and the knowledge
that the sheep were nearly half-way up the
range put him almost beside himself.</p>
<p>For a few moments the trio looked at one another
speechless. Then Bissell voiced the determination
of them all.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the devil&#8217;s mare!&#8221; he swore. &#8220;I won&#8217;t
be beaten by any sheepman that ever walked.
Stelton, how many men will be in to-night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fifteen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get &#8217;em and bring &#8217;em to me as soon as they
come.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the foreman went off about this business
Bissell learned from Chuck, the cowboy, just where
he had seen the sheep last, how fast they were
traveling, and how far he calculated they would
go before bedding down for the night.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon the outfit ought to camp somewhere
about Little Creek,&#8221; said Chuck. &#8220;That&#8217;s runnin&#8217;
water.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And how far beyond that is Little River?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Two miles more or less.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine. Wait around till the rest of the boys
come in, Chuck. Oh, by the way, how near are
the sheep to our eastern herd of cows?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Five miles more will bring &#8217;em to the range
the cows are on now.&#8221;</p>
<p>An hour before supper the rest of the punchers
began to come in from riding the range and rounding
up strays. Before they were permitted a
mouthful, however, Bissell went out to the bunk
house with Stelton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; he said, &#8220;which of you was down at
the Big Horn last night an&#8217; turned them sheep
back?&#8221;</p>
<p>A man spoke up and then two more who had
been left on guard in the vicinity.</p>
<p>&#8220;How many did you scatter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dunno, boss,&#8221; replied the first judicially.
&#8220;From the noise they made I allow there was at
least a thousand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I bet you a month&#8217;s wage there wasn&#8217;t
more&#8217;n a hundred,&#8221; said Bissell, glaring at the
puncher.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t take yer, boss,&#8221; returned the other
calmly. &#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because practically the whole flock is beddin&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
down at Little Creek now. Chuck seen &#8217;em.
Now I want all you fellers to get supper an&#8217; then
rope an&#8217; saddle a fresh hoss. There is shore
goin&#8217; to be some doin&#8217;s to-night.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>THE MAN IN THE MASK</h3>
</div>

<p>As Bud Larkin jogged along on Pinte, apparently
one of the group of men with whom
he was riding, he wondered mechanically why his
captors insisted on traveling ten miles to a tree sufficiently
stout to bear his weight.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think they&#8217;d stand me up and do the
business with a bullet,&#8221; he thought.</p>
<p>But a moment&#8217;s reflection furnished the answer
to this query. These men were cattle-rustlers and
horse-thieves, than which no more hazardous existence
ever was since the gentle days of West
Indian piracy, and to them merely a single pistol
shot might mean betrayal of their whereabouts,
capture and death.</p>
<p>The character of the country through which
they rode gave sufficient evidence of their care
in all details, for it was a rough, wild, uninhabitable
section that boasted, on its craggy heights and
rough coulees, barely enough vegetation to support
a wild mustang.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></p>
<p>It was three o&#8217;clock of the afternoon and behind
them the party could still see the place where
they had camped. Joe Parker, fearful of stirring
about much until the thoughts of range-riders
were turning homeward like their ponies&#8217; steps,
had delayed the departure beyond the hour first
intended.</p>
<p>The rustlers really did not want to dispose of
Larkin. Being plainsmen, their acute sense of justice
told them that this man was absolutely guiltless
of any crime deserving of death. Untoward
circumstances had forced him into their hands,
and, like the boy with the fly-paper, they were unable
to get rid of him peaceably. Their abuse of
his insane folly was colorful and vivid.</p>
<p>But Larkin had reasons for his stubborn attitude.
With the arrogance of youth and the inexperience
of real danger, he had resolved that as soon as
his sheep should be safely up the range he
would devote some time, money, and effort to the
running down of these rustlers. Some of their
faces were unforgetably stamped on his memory
now, and he had no doubt that he could be of
great service to Wyoming Territory, which was
just at this time petitioning for the dignity of
Statehood.</p>
<p>He had known the losses and insolence of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
rustlers on his own sheep ranch in Montana, and,
like every sympathizer with justice and order, had
sworn to himself many times that all of them
should be run to earth.</p>
<p>The longer Bud remained with the rustlers the
more nervous some of them became. Since morning
a number had been wearing masks made of
their neckerchiefs, and one man had not shown
his face since the moment he rode into camp after
the all-night drive. This man&#8217;s peculiar actions
piqued Bud&#8217;s curiosity, and he tried a number of
times to draw him into conversation. But the
rustler refused to speak and moved away whenever
he found himself in the prisoner&#8217;s vicinity.</p>
<p>About five o&#8217;clock the cavalcade arrived at a
point where, ahead of them, through the barren
buttes and hogbacks, they could see the long, level
expanse of the range; and, about half-way to the
horizon, a line of trees that indicated the snake-like
progress of a river. Here Joe called a halt
and gave orders that the party should lie concealed
until after dark, as the remainder of their
business could then be conducted with less danger
to themselves.</p>
<p>Accordingly the horsemen turned away from
the trail they had been following and after fifteen
minutes of tortuous riding, made camp on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
other side of a particularly uninviting wall of
rock.</p>
<p>After eating supper prepared around the little
fires Larkin saw the rustlers all gather into
a circle and start drawing lots. He shivered a
little at the thought that this was his execution
party being made up.</p>
<p>Four men had been designated as the number
to see Larkin off on his long journey, and when
at last the drawing was finished it was found that
Joe Parker, the masked rider, and two others
had been selected.</p>
<p>As darkness drew on Parker began to lose his
patience with Bud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look-a-here, Larkin,&#8221; he drawled, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
love no sheepmen, noways, an&#8217; I never did, but
you ain&#8217;t no ordinary &#8217;walker&#8217; an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t ashamed
to talk with y&#8217;u. Now the boys want to meet y&#8217;u
half-way on this business, an&#8217; you won&#8217;t do it.
All you got to say is that you won&#8217;t appear agin
any of us in any court, an&#8217; won&#8217;t ever say anythin&#8217;
agin any of us. Now what in blazes you&#8217;re
actin&#8217; like a mule balkin&#8217; at a shadder for, I dunno.
Be sensible.&#8221;</p>
<p>But to all such entreaties Larkin remained unmoved.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you hang me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you&#8217;ll only hang
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
yourselves, for all the sheepmen in Wyoming as
well as the men from my own ranch will come
down here, join with the cattlemen, and clean you
fellows out. And if my Basque herders start in
on you don&#8217;t imagine you will have the luxury of
hanging. They&#8217;ll take their skinning knives and
work from the neck down. No, I&#8217;d advise you to
let me go and take your chances rather than kill
me and wait.&#8221;</p>
<p>Such talk as this made a great impression on
some of the rustlers and again opened up the subject
of letting Larkin off. But the majority held
firm and the sentence stood.</p>
<p>It was perhaps eight o&#8217;clock when the party of
four approached Larkin and roused him up. This
time his hands were bound behind his back and he
noticed that the masked rustler was fastening them
tightly but with a rotten rawhide. This peculiar
circumstance caused a wild thrill to flash all
through Larkin&#8217;s being. Perhaps, after all, here
was the weak link in the rustler&#8217;s chain. The surmise
became a certainty when the man, unobserved
by his companions, sawed Bud&#8217;s arms back and
forth, showing him the quickest and easiest way
to work them loose.</p>
<p>Then came the greatest surprise of all. The
man, who had spoken no word the whole time,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
thrust a heavy .45 revolver into his trouser-pocket.
To permit this being done the eight-inch barrel
had been sawed off five inches short, ruining the
gun for ordinary use, but making it particularly
handy and light for close work.</p>
<p>This action convinced Larkin that the man in
the mask was not only willing that he should escape,
but was actually determined that the event
should occur. He also knew that he could count
on the support of this ally in the final moment
when the four men must fight it out two and
two.</p>
<p>Whether this sudden change of aspect was the
result of a determination by a minority of the
rustlers not to let the execution take place, or
whether by some miraculous means one of his own
friends had succeeded in joining the organization,
he could not determine, although he tried to sound
the man in the mask when the others were busy
with their horses. His only reply was a low hiss
commanding silence.</p>
<p>A quarter past the hour found them on their
way, the ponies picking their path gingerly over
the bad ground until they reached the range.
Here the three rustlers drew up short, for in the
distance could be seen the twinkling of a camp-fire.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></p>
<p>&#8220;One of the Bar T punchers,&#8221; said Joe; &#8220;but
I reckon he won&#8217;t hear us.&#8221;</p>
<p>For half a mile further they walked their horses,
and then urged them to a trot in the direction of
the river whose tree-lined banks they had seen
late in the afternoon. They paused only once
in this place, and then to cross a small stream
that lay in their path.</p>
<p>As he rode Larkin worked his arms cautiously
back and forth until he felt the rotten rawhide
give, and knew that a single violent motion would
free him entirely. But he refrained from making
that motion, feeling certain that the man in the
mask would give the signal when the time was
ripe.</p>
<p>At last they discerned the loom of the trees
against the low northern sky and pulled their
horses to a walk, until they arrived directly underneath
a big cottonwood, which stood in sinister
readiness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s your last chance,&#8221; said Parker in a
low voice. &#8220;If you swear as we have told you,
you can go free now. We take a man&#8217;s word
out here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never,&#8221; replied Larkin firmly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
waste time talking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shore not,&#8221; rejoined the other. &#8220;We always
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
grant a man&#8217;s last request. Come on, boys,
let&#8217;s finish this thing quick.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had hardly spoken when from the distance
came the sound of rapid revolver firing, mingled
with the wild shouts of men. For a few moments
the drama beneath the cottonwood came to an
abrupt halt.</p>
<p>&#8220;By gum!&#8221; cried Joe, &#8220;the Bar T punchers
have found the boys and there&#8217;s the devil to pay
back there. Lively, now.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the others took his lariat from the
throng at the side of his saddle and heaved the
coil over an outstretched limb of the cottonwood.
He had hardly done so when another sound
reached them, a low, menacing rumble that grew
momentarily louder until it reached a dull roar.</p>
<p>&#8220;A stampede!&#8221; bawled one of the men; &#8220;and
it&#8217;s heading this way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joe and the man in the mask still on their horses
led Pinte directly beneath the limb of the cottonwood,
and the former reached down to take the
noose of the rope from the one who had arranged
it. Suddenly Larkin felt a hand fumbling with
the rawhide about his arms, and a low voice in
his ear whispered: &#8220;Now.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the same motion Bud wrenched his hands
free and dug his spurs into the sides of his horse.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
Pinte, startled, leaped forward just as Larkin drew
the revolver from his pocket.</p>
<p>Joe, though caught by surprise, did not let go
of the bridle that was wound about his right hand,
but a blinding shot from the gun of the man in
the mask did the work. With a groan Parker
pitched forward out of his saddle and fell to the
ground just as Larkin fired pointblank at the third
man who appeared before him, still on foot.</p>
<p>The fellow went down, but not until a yellow
stab of light flashed up from where he had been
and Bud felt the wind of a bullet as it sped past
his cheek. The fourth man was nowhere to be
seen.</p>
<p>The stranger in the mask and the man he had
rescued were now alone, but their thoughts were
fully occupied. The sound of the distant stampede
had become a veritable rumbling roar that
told of its nearing proximity. Aside from this
drumming of many feet, there was no sound, for
the animals of the range when in the grip of panic
are silent.</p>
<p>With glazed eyes and muscles strained to the
utmost they thundered into the dark, unconscious
and heedless of the sure destruction in their path.
It was as though thousands of creatures, with their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
brains removed, had been turned loose to run at
will.</p>
<p>&#8220;To the river!&#8221; cried the masked man, suddenly
panic-stricken, spurring his horse in the direction
of the stream.</p>
<p>But Larkin was at his heels, and in a moment
had seized the other&#8217;s bridle and thrown the horse
back on his haunches.</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; bawled he at the top of his voice.
&#8220;The bank here is twenty feet high, and at the
bottom are rocks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better a jump and a chance than sure death
in the stampede,&#8221; yelled the stranger, but Bud
would not yield and drew the horse back.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can divide the herd,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Come,
we haven&#8217;t a moment to lose!&#8221;</p>
<p>They wheeled as one and dashed out of the
brush into the open of the range. The earth was
now trembling beneath them and the pounding feet
sounded a low, steady note, ominous with warning.
Occasionally there was a revolver shot, but
this was the only other sound.</p>
<p>Straight toward the oncoming living avalanche
the two men rode until they had left an open space
a hundred yards wide behind them. Then they
pulled up short and dismounted.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></p>
<p>Now out of the threatening thunder sounded
a single individual note, the rapid beating of a
horse&#8217;s feet&mdash;some horse that was bearing a desperate
rider ahead of the stampede but powerless
to avoid it.</p>
<p>Instantly Larkin saw the picture of the yawning
precipice toward which the frantic rider was hurrying
at breakneck speed. He raised his revolver
and fired into the air. The signal was instantly
acted on, for in another moment a lathering, heaving
pony dashed up to them, and the rider leaped
to the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, what shall I do? Hello! Who are
you?&#8221; cried a female voice, and Larkin&#8217;s heart
leaped as though it had turned over in its place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Juliet!&#8221; he cried, seizing the girl with one
arm and drawing her close.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bud!&#8221; For an instant she clung to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lead the horses together and shoot them!&#8221;
he ordered, although the others could scarcely hear
him.</p>
<p>Every instant was priceless now, for dimly at
the edge of their vision the front wave of the living,
leaping tide could be seen.</p>
<p>Larkin swung the girl&#8217;s horse alongside Pinte,
and without a thought or a pang shot them both.
They fell one on top of the other. Then the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
stranger in the mask led his animal in front of
the two that had fallen and put a bullet through
its brain. All now leaped behind this still throbbing
barricade.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got a gun, Julie?&#8221; demanded Bud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give it to me and load mine from your belt.&#8221;
They exchanged weapons and the girl with practiced
hand slipped the cartridges into their chambers.
The unknown had drawn two guns from
some place in his equipment, and now the three
peered over their shelter.</p>
<p>The advance line of animals was scarcely twenty-five
yards away, and, with a clutch of horror at his
heart, Bud recognized that they were not cattle
as he had supposed, but sheep&mdash;his own two thousand.</p>
<p>In the instant that remained he remembered
the shots and shouting of a quarter-hour before,
and realized that the animals had been stampeded
deliberately.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let &#8217;er go,&#8221; he screamed above the tumult,
&#8220;and yell like blazes!&#8221;</p>
<p>On the word yellow fire streamed out from
the four guns and, accompanying it, a perfect bedlam
of shrieks and cries. The sheep were now
upon them, and the hail of bullets dropped some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
in their headlong career, piling them up against
the horses and adding to the barricade. But it
could not stop all, and a stream of the animals
made its way over the bodies up to the very mouths
of the spitting guns.</p>
<p>Now others stumbled and fell, to be instantly
engulfed by the swirling flood behind; small, sharp
feet were caught between the limbs of the struggling
mass that eddied about the dead horses.
Still the yellow fire stabbed out into the faces of
the middlers&mdash;for now the leaders were already
piling up mangled and dying in the rocky river-bed&mdash;but,
past each side of this island of expiring
creatures, thundered a vast, heaving stream, turbulent,
silent, irrevocable.</p>
<p>The man in the mask with a revolver in each
hand was firing steadily, and Larkin, thrilled at
the sight of his apparent coolness, turned to look
at him.</p>
<p>To his amazement he found that the mask had
fallen or been snatched away. Again the man
fired, and Bud Larkin&#8217;s jaw fell as he gazed on
the queer, unmistakable features of the man who
had saved his life that night.</p>
<p>It was Smithy Caldwell.</p>
<p>The sheep mind has the power of tenacity, but
not that of change. There was scarcely a shot
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
left in the guns, and still the fear-blinded animals
battered at the growing wall of dead and dying
that divided them. But at last they began to
push to each side, and gradually the idea of splitting
took full hold.</p>
<p>Then the prisoners behind the dead horses sank
down in almost hysterical relief, for there was no
danger that any more would attempt to mount the
barricade. In fact, had the obstacle to their progress
been suddenly removed, the stampeded herds
would have continued to split for an indefinite
period.</p>
<p>Now, listening, Larkin could hear the crash of
the animals through the underbrush and the
horrid, sickening sounds of the writhing, half-dead
mass in the river-bed as more and more,
following their predecessors blindly, took the
leap.</p>
<p>At last the stream on each side thinned, the
rumbling thunder of pounding feet grew less, and
the tail of the flock passed, leaving behind it a
sudden, deathly silence. In the distance a faint
murmur was heard, and Larkin found later that
this was made by the two or three hundred which
escaped death in the river.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the great number of the
animals had filled the narrow gully, and the last
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
few charged across the bodies of their fallen comrades
to solid ground and safety beyond.</p>
<p>Now that the danger had passed, Larkin felt
a certain miserable nausea in the pit of his stomach,
and fought it down with all his might. Caldwell
was not so successful, however, and stumbled
from the shelter and his companions, furiously
sick. Juliet began to weep softly, the tears
of nervous reaction coming freely when neither
pain nor fear could have brought them.</p>
<p>Bud passed his arm gently about her shoulders,
and patted her with soft encouragement and praise
for her bravery. Nor did the girl resent his action.
Rather it seemed to steady her, and after
a few minutes she looked up with an unsteady
laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it funny for that other man to get seasick
out here where we can&#8217;t get enough water
to drink?&#8221; she asked, with a sudden tangent of
humor that made Bud laugh uproariously, and
seemed to relieve the strain that oppressed them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Brave little girl!&#8221; he said, getting up.
&#8220;That reminds me. I wonder where our friend
is?&#8221;</p>
<p>He walked out in the direction Caldwell had
taken and expected to find the other recovering
from his attack. But he could see or hear nothing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
to indicate that the man was within a dozen
miles. He called, and his voice sounded puny and
hollow against the vastness of the sky. He heard
no hails in answer, except the long, shrill one which
the coyotes gave from a neighboring rise of
ground.</p>
<p>Smithy Caldwell had disappeared.</p>
<p>Larkin returned to Juliet Bissell perplexed, mystified,
and disturbed. What possible reason could
there be for the quixotic actions of the man he
hated more than any other in the world? How
did he happen to be received and at perfect ease
among a band of desperate rustlers?</p>
<p>How and why? Caldwell presented so many
variations on those two themes that Larkin&#8217;s head
fairly swam, and he turned gladly to relieve the
situation in which Juliet Bissell now found herself.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>WAR WITHOUT QUARTER</h3>
</div>

<p>He found her where he had left her, but now
she was standing and looking out over the
silent prairies, as though searching for someone.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you trying to see?&#8221; Bud asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought father and some of the cowboys
would probably follow the sheep once they had
started them. Oh, what have I said?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I imagined it was they who had done it,&#8221; said
Bud quietly, the full enormity of the thing not yet
having sunk deep into his mind. &#8220;How did you
get mixed up in it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Simply enough,&#8221; replied Julie. &#8220;Late in the
afternoon Chuck, one of the men on the eastern
range, came riding in and said that your sheep
were directly east of the ranch house. Father and
Mike Stelton talked a lot about it at supper, and
figured up then that the easiest way&mdash;well, to
teach you a lesson, they called it&mdash;was to run
them over the bank of the Little River.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like sheep, Bud, as you know; but that
was going too far for me, and I protested, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
the result that father took Mike outside with him,
quite upset that I said anything at all. Both of
them looked black as a silk hat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good little girl!&#8221; cried Bud gratefully, and
she turned her face directly toward him and smiled;
just such a smile, Larkin remembered, as he had
seen her use on other soft nights years before,
in circumstances so totally different.</p>
<p>&#8220;After supper,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;there was a
great bustle of getting away, and I grew curious
to see what they would do and how. So as soon
as they left I saddled my calico and set out after
them, keeping about abreast but a couple of miles
to the north. The next thing I heard was a terrific
lot of shooting and yelling, and the business was
done. I don&#8217;t wonder the sheep were in a panic!</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I heard the sound of the stampede, but
I did not realize it was driving straight at me.
I must have been confused in my idea of where the
Little River was. Anyway, before I had time to
think about it I realized I was directly in their
path and with a very small advantage. I could
escape neither to right nor left, for the wings of
the running flock were wide, and all I could do was
to run my pony as hard as he could go.</p>
<p>&#8220;He seemed to know the danger; all cow
ponies do, I guess, for I never saw him travel like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
that in all my life; he stretched so flat along the
ground that it almost seemed as though I could
reach down and touch it with my hand. You know
what such speed as that is at night with the gopher-holes
and other ankle-breakers! Well, we took
the chance, and Billy actually drew away from the
sheep, panicky as they were.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I couldn&#8217;t gain enough to dare to turn
to right or left, and I had just about given up hope
because the trees were ahead, when I saw the flash
and heard the report of your gun. Thank God
it was you, Bud. I&#8217;ve never known you to be a
coward or to fail in any situation. I can&#8217;t say
how grateful I am for what you have done to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I assure you I didn&#8217;t do it, Julie; it was that
man who got sick and left us. He&#8217;s disappeared
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was he? One of the Bar T punchers?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it was that fellow, Caldwell. Perhaps
you don&#8217;t remember him&mdash;he came to the Bar T
for supper the same night I did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I remember him,&#8221; said Julie in a tone
out of which all the impetuous warmth had gone.
Suddenly in this strange situation she found herself
face to face with another chapter in the mystery
that baffled her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he saved my life to-night, and, though
I can&#8217;t say I admire the fellow very much, I am
mighty grateful to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is strange you two should be together out
here when your sheep were somewhere else,&#8221; hazarded
Juliet, looking full at Larkin and expecting
some action or word to betray his fear of her suspicions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all strange when you know the circumstances,&#8221;
he replied. &#8220;Just listen to this tale
of adventure. But first I think we had better
start walking toward the Bar T ranch house. We
ought to meet some of the cowboys. Br-r&mdash;it&#8217;s
cold!&#8221; and Bud shivered in the piercing chill
of the spring night.</p>
<p>To the plainsman walking is the most refined
form of punishment. Your real cowboy slouches
miserably along in his tight-fitting, uncomfortable
high-heeled boots, looking about as much in his
element as a stranded whale. In cowboy parlance
his &#8220;feet don&#8217;t track,&#8221; his backbone wilts, and his
knees bow naturally as a result of early horseback
riding. On solid earth the cowboy is a crestfallen
and dejected object.</p>
<p>As the two trudged along beneath the calm stars
that had seen a thousand stampedes since the millions
of buffalo roared up and down its length,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
Larkin told Juliet of the events that had occurred
since they had said farewell at the fork of Grassy
Creek. At the mention of the rustlers and the
activities they were carrying on the girl gave a
little, low cry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father must hear that,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He
would give a lot to have descriptions of those
men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He couldn&#8217;t give me back two thousand sheep
and lambs,&#8221; rejoined Bud bitterly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but I think he would give you their
value.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and stampede it into another gully when
I brought it across his range. Juliet, I&#8217;m not
done with this thing. I&#8217;ll fight your father or any
other man that ever heard a calf bawl for milk,
until I get my rights on the free range.&#8221;</p>
<p>Larkin&#8217;s voice was deep and full-throated with
the righteous anger that surged through him over
the outrage that had been wrought that night.</p>
<p>As for the girl, she did not recognize this Bud
Larkin. The man she had known had been one
of gay pleasantries, but rather ineffectual endeavors;
this man who spoke was one to whom his will
was his law, and obstacles merely helps because of
their strengthening of his determination. For the
first time she saw the Bud Larkin that had developed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
in the last year, and a kind of admiring
thrill at the mental stature of the man went
through her.</p>
<p>And yet she knew that war&mdash;hard, tenacious,
ugly war&mdash;war without quarter, mercy, or respite,
was irrevocably declared between Larkin and her
father; and, even in her instinctive loyalty to her
house, she had to admit that Bud was justified.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I wish you would give the whole thing
up!&#8221; she said plaintively. &#8220;It will only result
in ruin to everybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>Larkin laughed harshly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never give it up until I am either dead or
haven&#8217;t a dollar left,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I am determined
to have my rights in this matter, and I shall
have them whatever the cost.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a time there was silence between them, each
realizing that further discussion could only prove
unhappy.</p>
<p>They had gone about two miles from the scene
of the stampede when suddenly a man appeared
close in front of them and commanded them to
halt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Sims!&#8221; cried Larkin joyfully, recognizing
the other&#8217;s voice, but at the same time
hoisting his hands above his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, chief,&#8221; said the herder imperturbably,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
returning his revolver to its holster, &#8220;I allow your
vacation has cost you a lot of money.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bud then outlined his experiences briefly, concluding
with his story of the stampede, and Sims
whistled in amazement, his one method of expressing
astonishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s the story now?&#8221; Bud asked.</p>
<p>Juliet had walked ahead when the two men
met, and now Larkin dropped far enough behind
to be out of ear-shot and yet keep the girl dimly
in sight.</p>
<p>Hurriedly, for him, Sims related the story of
the ill-fated expedition up to the time of the
stampede. He and the herders had put up what
defense they could, he said, and, as a result, two
of his men were dead and the others scattered.
However, he expected they would return to the
now deserted camp.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to take them back south to the Badwater
River,&#8221; ordered Larkin. &#8220;The second
flock ought to be there by this time, but I want
you to hold them there. In two days the boys
from Montana ought to be down, and when you&#8217;re
ready to start north you will have force enough
to fight any bunch of cowboys old Bissell can
scrape together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if we don&#8217;t move that flock out right away
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
the others will come and pile up there, and then
we shore will have our hands full.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, let &#8217;em pile up. We&#8217;ll get &#8217;em
through just the same. Now, Sims, we are in this
thing for blood from now on, and don&#8217;t you forget
it for a minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Trust me, boss,&#8221; drawled the herder. &#8220;Are
you comin&#8217; down to join us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, if I can. As soon as I get Miss Bissell
into safe hands I&#8217;ll come. But don&#8217;t count on me;
I may never get there. Do whatever you think
best, but bring those sheep through. And tell the
herders and the boys from the north that while
this trouble is on I&#8217;ll pay them five dollars a day
apiece.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shore, they&#8217;d rassle the devil himself for
that,&#8221; commented Sims.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you get ten,&#8221; supplemented Larkin.
&#8220;Now go ahead and make all preparations the
way you think best. Everything is in your
hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sims faded from sight noiselessly, and Larkin
hurried forward to overtake Juliet. They had
not been together five minutes when the rapid
trotting of horses was heard ahead and Larkin,
taking the chance of falling into evil hands, called
out to the travelers.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s there?&#8221; came a gruff voice, accompanied
by the click of hammers drawn back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, father, it&#8217;s I&mdash;Juliet!&#8221; cried the girl,
recognizing the speaker and running toward
him.</p>
<p>There was a surprised exclamation out of the
darkness, and the sound of a man vaulting from
the saddle. The next moment and he had clasped
his daughter in his arms.</p>
<p>Larkin, his mission completed, started to back
away from the scene, but the girl herself wrecked
this intention.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was Mr. Larkin who called out,&#8221; she said,
evidently in answer to a question. &#8220;He saved my
life, father, and he has brought me safely back.
He is standing right over there.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this Bud turned and ran, but the sound of
a pony closing in on him brought him to a stop.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what do you want?&#8221; he demanded
angrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bissell wants to see you,&#8221; said the rider whose
voice the sheepman recognized as that of Stelton.</p>
<p>Not deigning to enter an argument with the
foreman, Bud walked back to where Bissell stood
beside his horse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now the sheep are out of the way, if you want
to learn anything about rustlers I guess our friend
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
here can tell you,&#8221; remarked Stelton suddenly, in
a voice exultant as it was ugly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, father,&#8221; added Juliet, &#8220;he&#8217;s been
with them for almost two days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this so, Mr. Larkin?&#8221; asked Bissell.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we won&#8217;t discuss it now,&#8221; said the cowman.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s go back to the ranch house and get
something to eat. I have an extra horse here,
Larkin, if you care to ride.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care to, thanks,&#8221; answered Bud dryly.
&#8220;Since you have ruined me, you will do me a favor
by letting me go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I allow I&#8217;d like to do you a favor,&#8221; rejoined
Bissell with equal courtesy, &#8220;but I&#8217;ve got to find
out about them rustlers. We won&#8217;t keep yuh
long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, get up on that horse,&#8221; said the
voice of Stelton close beside him, and Bud turned
to look into the long barrel of the foreman&#8217;s gun
that was stuck under his nose.</p>
<p>Trembling with suppressed fury, he did as he
was told, but on the ten-mile ride to the Bar T
ranch said nothing, and only revolved in his mind
one question: How did Stelton know he had been
with the rustlers before Julie had said anything
about them?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>MADE PRISONER</h3>
</div>

<p>At three o&#8217;clock the next afternoon Beef Bissell
felt better than he had for some time,
this condition being a result of his vindictive triumph
over Bud Larkin, and the fact that that
young man was in his hands. He felt that the
back of the sheep business had been broken as far
as his range and his county were concerned.</p>
<p>I have put the opening of this chapter at three
o&#8217;clock, because that was the hour at which life
began to be manifest at the Bar T ranch after the
stirring events of the night before. Bud Larkin
himself, worn out with his nights and days of
vigil, had gone to sleep on his bed almost in the
act of taking his boots off. Vague ideas of escape
had coursed through his mind only to be overtaken
and killed by the slumber he had evaded for so
long.</p>
<p>His window faced southwest, and when he
awoke it was to find the dazzling gold of the sun
warming his face. For a moment he did not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
realize where he was, staring thus into the blinding
radiance; but memory is only a few seconds sleepier
than its master, and shortly everything came back
to him.</p>
<p>A sinking sensation came over him as he remembered
the wanton slaughter of his sheep, more because
of the helpless agony of the poor dumb brutes
than because of the monetary loss, although the
latter was no trifling consideration, since nearly
eight thousand dollars had been wiped out in less
than half an hour.</p>
<p>Added to this sickening sensation was one of
dull, choking rage that Bissell, a man of wealth
and certain prominence in the State, should suggest
and pursue a course that the most despised sheep-herder
would never countenance. That, Larkin
told himself, showed the real man; the rough,
crude product of a rough and bitter country.</p>
<p>For the slogan of the earlier West was selfishness.</p>
<p>&#8220;All this is mine and don&#8217;t you come a-nigh
me!&#8221; bawled the cowman when the nesters or
grangers began to make their appearance.</p>
<p>The cowboy himself was the chief exponent of
this philosophy. Restraint was unknown to him&mdash;his
will was his law, and he tried to make it
everyone else&#8217;s. When thousands of men have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
the same idea the result is trouble; hence the practice
of cluttering up one&#8217;s person with artillery.</p>
<p>The one person for whom the cow-puncher had
no respect and for whom the cow country was no
fit abiding place was the man who allowed himself
to be domineered. For that man convict-labor
on a coral road would have been paradise
compared to his ordinary existence.</p>
<p>Thus was the West the supreme abode at that
time of the selfists or anarchists who have no
thought or consideration outside their own narrow
motives and desires.</p>
<p>Though Bud Larkin could not have analyzed his
feelings in words, perhaps, yet he felt this keenly,
and knew that now or never must he take his
stand and keep it. He labored under the double
handicap, in this country, of having gone in for
sheep and having been beaten at it the very first
thing. Consequently, if he ever expected to gain
any caste, or at least a hearing, he must turn the
tables and that as soon as possible.</p>
<p>At the present moment, as he washed his face
in the thick white wash-bowl that made the guest-room
of the Bar T celebrated for leagues around,
he had nothing but the remotest ideas of how this
might be done. The fact, in brief, was that his
sheep were and would continue piling up in the hills
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
north of the Badwater, ready to enter the hazardous
stretch of dry territory that had so nearly been
disastrous to his first flock.</p>
<p>Until he should be free and could reconnoiter
his chances and resources he would hesitate to
order them sent north. And yet they could not
stay forever near the Badwater. Neither could
they be halted on their march north, because they
were crossing the range of Wyoming sheepmen
at the time and common plains courtesy demanded
that they be removed as fast as possible.</p>
<p>But for the fact that Sims was in personal charge
Bud Larkin would have been in utter despair.
Such was his confidence in his indolent herdsman
that he felt that though ultimate failure attended
their efforts no blame could ever be attached to
Sims.</p>
<p>Leaving the guest-chamber, Larkin immediately
stepped into the dining-room and the gloomy
thoughts fled, for there sat Juliet near the window,
sewing. She greeted him with a smile and immediately
rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Man, I thought you would never
wake up,&#8221; she remarked in mock reproof. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
been waiting here since dinner to see that you had
something to eat when you came out. You must
be wild hungry.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I could eat a saddle,&#8221; said Larkin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry, but the saddles are all out,&#8221; she replied
with a smile. &#8220;However, we have some nice
fresh broiled quirts, garnished with rawhide.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bring me a double order,&#8221; said Bud, laughing,
as he seated himself.</p>
<p>When he was almost through with his meal
Juliet remarked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Father asked me to say that he would like to
have a talk with you on the veranda when you were
ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go right out,&#8221; he answered, thanking her
for the trouble she had taken.</p>
<p>He found Bissell seated in one of the big chairs
outside, and took the other. Both men rolled a
cigarette and then Bissell spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;I owe you a great deal, Larkin, for saving my
daughter last night,&#8221; he said with genuine emotion
in his voice. &#8220;Under the circumstances I am
sorry for what I did, and wish I had it to do over
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As for the first, I don&#8217;t deserve much credit.
Juliet really saved her own life by coming to us
when I fired the warning shot. As to the sheep,
it&#8217;s too late to think about them now; we&#8217;ll come
to another reckoning in that matter later on. I&#8217;d
hardly expect a horse-thief to do a trick like that.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></p>
<p>Bissell&#8217;s tanned face turned a deep mahogany
hue under the sting of this remark, and his eyes
lost the soft look they had held when he spoke of
Juliet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m willing to pay yuh the money loss,&#8221; he replied,
still anxious to make amends.</p>
<p>&#8220;On guarantee, I suppose, that I don&#8217;t try to
bring the rest of my sheep north.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s impossible, as you might know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I allow you&#8217;re right foolish, Mr. Larkin; better
think it over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did that last night when the sheep went into
the river,&#8221; said Bud dryly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose so, but a night&#8217;s sleep sometimes
changes a man&#8217;s mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not mine. The first night I was here I told
you that I would bring my sheep north, and I still
intend to do it. I am always willing to meet a
man half-way; but you wouldn&#8217;t meet me. Instead
of that you started in to ruin me. I have
no objection to that, but you&#8217;d better take care that
your schemes don&#8217;t work two ways.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bissell shrugged his shoulders. He still had
the upper-hand of the situation, and his temper,
in that case, was not hard to control.</p>
<p>&#8220;I allow I can look out for myself,&#8221; he said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt, but you had better look out for
me,&#8221; was the retort.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon I&#8217;ll manage,&#8221; remarked Bissell contemptuously.
&#8220;But all this isn&#8217;t what I wanted
to ask you. I&#8217;d be some pleased if you&#8217;d tell me
about them rustlers you were with.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you want to know about them?&#8221;
countered Bud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because they&#8217;re ruinin&#8217; the cattle business. I
dunno how many head they run off last year, but
I do know that profits were cut in half by &#8217;em.
You was with &#8217;em long enough to know some of
&#8217;em again, I allow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I would know nearly all of them.
What&#8217;s left of three is out there near the cottonwoods
along Little River, but I don&#8217;t believe
there&#8217;s enough to bury.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How is that?&#8221; inquired Bissell, who had evidently
not heard of Larkin&#8217;s narrow escape from
death at the rustler&#8217;s hands.</p>
<p>Bud told him briefly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You shore were lucky,&#8221; remarked the cowman
with a Westerner&#8217;s appreciation of the situation.
&#8220;Now, I&#8217;m the head of the cattlemen&#8217;s association
in this part of the State, and o&#8217; course it&#8217;s our
business to clear the country of those devils.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
You&#8217;re just the man we want, because you&#8217;ve seen
&#8217;em and know who they are. You tell me what
yuh know and there&#8217;ll be the biggest hangin&#8217; bee
this State ever seen.&#8221;</p>
<p>As has been said, Bud Larkin had the legitimate
owner&#8217;s hatred of these thieves who preyed
on the work of honest men, and had sworn to
help run them out of the country as soon as his
own business was finished. Now, in the flash of
an eye he saw where he could turn the knowledge
he had gained to good account.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have rather queer ideas of me, Mr. Bissell,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;First, you fight me until I am
nearly ruined, then you expect I will turn around
and help you just as though nothing had happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But in this,&#8221; cried the cowman, &#8220;you&#8217;ve got
to help us. This is all outside of a war between
the cows and the sheep. This is a matter of right
and justice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So is the matter of my sheep. The range is
free and you won&#8217;t let me use it. Do you call
that right or just, either one?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bissell choked on his own reply, and grew red
with anger. Suddenly, without exactly knowing
how, the tables had been turned on him. Now,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
instead of being the mighty baron with the high
hand, he was the seeker for help, and this despised
sheepman held the trump cards.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Larkin&#8217;s direct question was
capable of a damaging reply. Bissell sought
desperately for a means of escape from the trap
in which he found himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean, young feller, that you won&#8217;t
tell me about them rustlers?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s about it. But I might on one condition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That your cattlemen&#8217;s association give the rest
of my sheep undisturbed passage north across the
range to Montana.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By gosh!&#8221; yelled the cowman, beside himself,
springing out of his chair and glaring at the
other with clenched hands on his hips. &#8220;That&#8217;s
your game, is it? Yuh pull our teeth an&#8217; then
offer us grub, eh? Why, tan my hide&mdash;&#8221; he
gagged with wrath and stood speechless, a picture
of impotent fury.</p>
<p>Larkin laughed quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The shoe&#8217;s on the other foot, but it doesn&#8217;t
seem to feel any too good,&#8221; he sneered. &#8220;Better
be reasonable now, hadn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Reasonable? Sure, I&#8217;ll be reasonable!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
cried the other vindictively, almost suffocated with
his emotion. &#8220;Let me ask yuh something. Do
you absolutely refuse to tell about them rustlers
if I don&#8217;t do as you want and let your sheep
through?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, not exactly,&#8221; replied Bud, grinning.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you this: they&#8217;re going to run off a hundred
head or so of your stock yet this week for
the railroad camps up the State. I think it&#8217;s fair
to give you warning beforehand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Darn you and your warning! What I want
is the names and descriptions of them men. Will
yuh give &#8217;em to me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not unless we can strike a bargain. You
talk about right and justice. Now let&#8217;s see a little
of it,&#8221; answered Larkin.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, young feller, you&#8217;ve said your say.
Now listen to me. I&#8217;m a deputy sheriff in this
county&#8221;&mdash;he ripped open his vest and showed the
badge pinned to the inside lining&mdash;&#8220;an&#8217; I hereby
arrest yuh for bein&#8217; a party to them rustlers. Yer
either a criminal or yuh ain&#8217;t, accordin&#8217; to our
notions out here, an&#8217; if yuh wun&#8217;t help us catch yer
friends there ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; more to be said. Now
roll that into a cigarette an&#8217; eat it alive if yuh
want to.&#8221;</p>
<p>He glared defiantly down on Larkin, whose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
brows had drawn together as he went into executive
session with himself.</p>
<p>In five seconds the situation between these men
was once more reversed. It was not that Larkin
had overreached himself; he simply had encountered
a circumstance of which he was unaware.
The possibility of Bissell being a deputy sheriff had
never occurred to him, and now he sat balked and
perplexed, balancing his chances on either hand.</p>
<p>It was not in the man to yield supinely to this
new danger. He could not even think of the possibility
without shame. He was right, he told himself
over and over again, and, listen as he would,
he could detect no contradictory reply from the
still, small voice we are all credited with possessing.</p>
<p>His mission in life was to get his sheep through.
In that circumstance the rustlers were unexpected
allies and he hoped they would put burs under the
tails of every steer on the range and drive them
to the Gulf of Mexico. Once his merinos and
angoras were safe across the line Bud would gladly
return and help round them up.</p>
<p>The idea that he, clipped, helpless, and harmless
as he was, should now turn in and assist his
despoilers to better their own fortunes was so maddening
that he grinned with fury as he thought
of it. No, the thing was impossible!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></p>
<p>Bissell had not changed his menacing position
during all of Bud Larkin&#8217;s ponderings and was
waiting patiently for some outbreak from his victim.
But at last he could stand it no more.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he snarled, &#8220;say something! What&#8217;s
your answer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That bargain goes as she stands,&#8221; said Bud,
after a moment&#8217;s thought. &#8220;You help me and
I&#8217;ll help you. Otherwise you won&#8217;t get a word
out of me, and you can do whatever you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re under arrest,&#8221; snapped Bissell.
&#8220;Give me your gun!&#8221; and he covered Bud with a
single swift motion of his hand.</p>
<p>The younger man did as commanded and rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now go into that room; you&#8217;re a prisoner,&#8221;
ordered Bissell.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>JULIET ASSERTS HERSELF</h3>
</div>

<p>Now that the owner of the Bar T ranch
had succeeded again in a match of wits
with Larkin, he put sheep out of his mind and
turned his attention to the more-immediate danger
of rustlers. It had been a matter of a couple of
years since the last determined attempt of the cowmen
to oust these poachers by force of arms, and
Bissell thought that the time was ripe for another
and, if possible, final expedition.</p>
<p>With Larkin in his power, he had no doubt
that the necessary information could be procured
from him in one way or another, and, after talking
matters over with Stelton, dispatched cowboys
at top speed to the ranches in his district,
asking that the owners and as many men as they
could spare should come at once to a conference
at the Bar T.</p>
<p>Having got them there, it was his intention to
sweat Larkin for names and descriptions, and then
let him go. Should the sheepman refuse all information,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
then his case could be acted upon by the
members of the association without any further
delay.</p>
<p>All these plans Larkin learned from Juliet and
her mother, who looked after most of his wants.
The latter, good woman, quite flustered at having
what she termed a &#8220;regular boarder,&#8221; became
rather fond of the patient young man from the
East who never failed to listen attentively to her
narrative of the famous trip to St. Paul.</p>
<p>The regular boarder, for his part, could not but
sympathize with this homely, hard-working, lonely
woman. One rarely connected Martha Bissell
with old Beef Bissell except in an impersonal way,
as one would have connected the corral, or the
barn, or the brand. In fact, the cowman seemed
hardly cognizant of her existence, long since having
transferred all the affections his hard life had
left him to the daughter he worshiped.</p>
<p>But Martha, as is so often the case with women
who grow old slaving for their husbands, had not
changed in her devotion to Bissell since the proud
day they had eloped on one horse and been married
by a &#8220;sky pilot&#8221; in the nearest cow town.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bissell had come to that dolorous time in
a woman&#8217;s life when she no longer has the power
of attracting male attention&mdash;which power is not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
a matter of age, but merely of mind and spirit.
And yet there were depths in her, Larkin found,
unsuspected because unsought.</p>
<p>Loving her daughter as she loved her husband,
she derived a certain negative happiness from the
fact that their exclusive companionship brought
them pleasure.</p>
<p>For herself she asked nothing, and, as is the
way of the world, she got it.</p>
<p>For Bud Larkin, who had only known her as
an angular, uninteresting addendum of the Bar
T, she took on a certain pathetic interest, and he
went out of his way to talk with her about the
glories of Chicago, since her one dissipation
seemed to be mental journeys back East.</p>
<p>Larkin was not strictly a prisoner at the Bar T
ranch-house, for this had been found impracticable
from a number of standpoints. He had the run
of the ranch, an old, decrepit cow pony to ride,
and could go in any direction he chose under the
supervision of a cowboy who carried a Winchester
and was known to have impaled flies on cactus
spines at thirty yards.</p>
<p>Occasionally Bud and Juliet rode out together,
with this man in the rear, and renewed the old
friendship that had lain dormant for so long.
During one of these rides the girl, after debating
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
the matter with herself, opened on a delicate
subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;That Caldwell man is a strange-looking fellow,
Bud. Who is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>Larkin looked at Juliet closely before replying,
but could find nothing in her face to indicate any
but a natural curiosity.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is a Chicago character I used to know,&#8221;
he returned shortly. &#8220;But what brought him out
here is a puzzle to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You seemed to want to see him pretty badly,&#8221;
said she, assuming a pout. &#8220;I was really jealous
of him taking you off the way he did that first
night you came.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the first time I have been flattered with
your jealousy,&#8221; Bud returned gayly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll ask
him to come again.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that was the closest she could come to a discussion
of Caldwell&#8217;s connection with Larkin.
The fact, although she would not admit it, gave
her more concern than it should have, and kept
her constantly under a cloud of uneasiness. Bud&#8217;s
evasion of the subject added strength to the fear
that there was really something horrible in Bud&#8217;s
past.</p>
<p>It was on one of his rides alone that Bud suddenly
came to a very unflattering solution of another
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
problem in regard to Caldwell. Ever since
the stampede he had been giving time to the consideration
of Smithy&#8217;s strange actions that night.
There was no love lost between the two, that was
certain, and why the blackmailer should risk his
life to defeat the rustlers and save the man he
hated was beyond Bud&#8217;s comprehension.</p>
<p>But at last he arrived at a solution that removed
all his doubts, and this was that Smithy Caldwell
had saved him for the same reason that the old
lady in the fairy story was told to preserve the
goose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kill the goose and there will be no more golden
eggs,&#8221; remarked the fairy sagely, and evidently
Caldwell was ready to heed her advice.</p>
<p>It certainly was worth the effort on Smithy&#8217;s
part, and even when Larkin had finally discovered
the man&#8217;s sordid motives he felt a species of admiration
for the man&#8217;s coolness and bravery. He
felt, too, that, if he could not get a grip on the
blackmailer before another payment was demanded,
he could part with the money for the
first time with the feeling that Caldwell had
partially earned it.</p>
<p>As to Caldwell&#8217;s presence among the rustlers,
that was another matter entirely, and Larkin could
not fathom the mystery. How Smithy, a low
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
Chicago tough, whose only knowledge of a horse
had been gained by observation, could so quickly
become a trusted member of this desperate gang
of cattle-thieves he could not conceive. Was there
some occult power about the man&mdash;some almost
hypnotic influence that passed his crossed eyes and
narrow features in that company?</p>
<p>Larkin gave it up. But he knew that, should
he ever again get his full liberty, his sheep safely
across the range, and the leisure to pursue rustlers,
Mr. Smithy Caldwell of Chicago would be his
especial prey. And he grinned with anticipation
at the glory of that moment when he should have
the blackmailer in his power with enough evidence
to swing him.</p>
<p>Stelton was the one man of the whole Bar T
outfit who had suffered from the boomerang of
his evil plans. It had been through him that
Larkin was forced to accompany Bissell home after
the stampede; and now he passed days and nights
of misery, watching the progress of Bud&#8217;s very
evident suit. Chained down by his daily round
of duties, his time was not his own, and with a
green venom eating at his heart he watched the
unfettered Bud ride off across the plains with
Juliet, laughing, care-free, and apparently happy.</p>
<p>So greatly did this irk Mr. Stelton that his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
morose melancholy increased to a point where his
own cowpunchers entertained fears for his sanity,
and made him acquainted with the fact in their
well-known tender manner. This did not serve
to buoy his spirits, and he cursed himself roundly
for the ridiculous position into which he had led
himself.</p>
<p>As to Juliet, he hardly dared pass a civil time of
day with her, so terrible a trial had his thwarted
desires in regard to her become.</p>
<p>The fourth day after Bud&#8217;s arrest old Beef
Bissell called for his horse and rode away to the
Circle Arrow ranch. Old man Speaker had not
seen fit to rally to the cowmen&#8217;s gathering, and
Bissell valued his counsel very much; he had,
therefore, gone to fetch him.</p>
<p>During the three days of his absence Mike
Stelton suffered another of those reverses which
are so exasperating because they are brought about
by our own ugly spirits.</p>
<p>All the time he had continued to eat at the
ranch table, and had been accorded his share of
the conversation and attention. Now, with old
Bissell out of the way, his status immediately
changed. Mrs. Bissell, Juliet, and Bud were the
best of friends, and presented a solid front of uniform
but uninterested politeness to the foreman
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
against which he was helpless. On the second day,
for the first time in ten years, he moved his seat
down into the punchers&#8217; dining-room and ate with
them.</p>
<p>Such a defeat as this could not pass unnoticed
among the punchers, who had never been accorded
the pleasure of their gloomy foreman&#8217;s presence
at meal times, and Stelton suffered keenly from the
gibes of the men.</p>
<p>Stelton endured all this with seeming calmness,
but when Bissell returned the foreman got his revenge.
He outlined with full detail and considerable
embellishment the constant progress that
Larkin was making with Juliet. Disclaiming any
interest of his own in the matter, he explained that
the reason for his complaint was the character of
Larkin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, boss, yuh shore wouldn&#8217;t want a darned
sheepman breakin&#8217; Julie&#8217;s heart,&#8221; he said, &#8220;an&#8217;
him a Eastern dude at that. You should &#8217;a&#8217; seen
that feller. Yuh no more&#8217;n got yore back turned
than he carried on with Juliet all the time. It
made me plenty mad, too; but what could I do
about it? I just moved my grub-pile down with
the boys an&#8217; thought I&#8217;d tell yuh when yuh came
home.&#8221;</p>
<p>A half an hour of this was sufficient to work
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
Bissell up into a furious rage, and, in something
the same temper, he sent for Juliet an hour before
dinner.</p>
<p>Now, a man who is subjected to choleric outbursts
should never send for anything but food
an hour before dinner, for the reason that a very
trivial thing looks, at that time, big enough to
wreck the nation. Bissell, however, failed to
recollect this simple truth, and greeted his daughter
with smoldering eyes, that gradually softened,
however, the longer he looked at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is somethin&#8217; I want to ask yuh, Prairie
Bell,&#8221; he began. &#8220;Yuh won&#8217;t mind?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, dear,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This sheepman Larkin&mdash;is it true yuh been
courtin&#8217; with him while I been away?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been riding with him a good deal, and
I&#8217;ve seen him every day, if that is what you mean.
You trust me to be sensible, don&#8217;t you, father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Julie, o&#8217; course I do; but I&#8217;m just thinkin&#8217;
of yerself&mdash;and of me. Dunno what people&#8217;d
say if they knowed ol&#8217; Bissell&#8217;s daughter was
traipsin&#8217; around with a sheepman that stands in
with the rustlers. An&#8217; you&mdash;I allow it&#8217;d break
my heart if yuh ever got fond of that rascal. He&#8217;s
a bad lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t agree with you in any of those things,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
said the girl, with just the right mixture of determination
and affection in her voice. &#8220;To anyone
who is fair, it is no disgrace to be a sheepman;
Mr. Larkin is not in with the rustlers, as I believe
he outlined to you, nor is he a rascal in any way.
Lastly, I don&#8217;t care what people say about whom
I ride with. Mr. Larkin is a gentleman, and that
is all I require.&#8221;</p>
<p>During this speech, which held the middle
ground between daring and prudence, independence
and acquiescence, civility and impertinence, Bissell&#8217;s
jaw dropped and his eyes opened. He had rarely,
if ever, known his daughter to make such an explicit
refutal of his inferences. His brow
darkened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yuh never stuck up fer a man like that in yore
life, Julie,&#8221; he accused her severely. &#8220;That
Larkin is a bad one. Mebbe yuh don&#8217;t know it,
but he can&#8217;t answer for everything in his life. O&#8217;
course, you can&#8217;t understand these things, but I&#8217;m
just tellin&#8217; yuh. Now, I&#8217;m plumb sorry to have to
do it, but I want yuh to tell me yuh won&#8217;t go out
with him any more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you should ask me that, father,&#8221;
said the girl quietly. &#8220;I am old enough to choose
my own associates. I have known Mr. Larkin
for years, where you have only known him for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
days. I love you too much to disgrace you or
mother, daddy dear; but you must not ask me to
act like a fifteen-year-old schoolgirl.&#8221;</p>
<p>To Bissell, after dinner, this talk would have
served its intended purpose&mdash;that of presenting
reasonably the reverse side of the argument.
Now, however, it merely stirred him up. He
looked sharply at his daughter with his small,
piercing eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you defy me?&#8221; he thundered, amazed at
the girl&#8217;s temerity. &#8220;All I do is try to think up
ways of makin&#8217; yuh happy, an&#8217; now yuh insist on
havin&#8217; this scoundrel make love to yuh, whether
I want it or not. Answer me this, Julie, are you
in love with him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never met another man I cared as much
for,&#8221; she returned with calm frankness, looking at
him with big, unafraid brown eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Great Heavens!&#8221; cried Bissell, leaping out
of his chair and raising his clenched fists above
his head. &#8220;That I should come to this! Julie,
do yuh know what yore sayin&#8217;? Do yuh know
what yore doin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I do; and do you want to know the reason
for it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I think the things that have been done
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
to Mr. Larkin are contemptible and mean.&#8221;
There was no placidity in those brown eyes now.
They flashed fire. Her face had grown pale, and
she, too, had risen to her feet. &#8220;I&#8217;m a cowman&#8217;s
daughter, but still I can be reasonable.
Our range is free range, and he has a perfect right
to walk his sheep north if he wants to. And
even if he hadn&#8217;t, there is no excuse for the stampede
that took place the other night.</p>
<p>&#8220;And last of all, you have no right to keep
Mr. Larkin here against his will so that he does
not know what is happening to the rest of his
flocks. I consider the whole thing a hideous outrage.
But that isn&#8217;t all. You have talked to me
this afternoon in a suspicious manner that you
have no right to use toward me. I am not a child,
and shall think and act for myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that? That you will
help this scoundrel?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, if I think it is the right thing to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bissell started back as though someone had
struck him. Then he seemed to lose his strength
and to shrivel up, consumed by the flame of his
bitterness and disappointment. At the sight, the
girl&#8217;s whole heart melted toward the unhappy
man, and she longed to throw her arms around
him and plead for forgiveness. But the same
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
strain that had made her father what he was, in
his hard environment, was dominant in her, and
she stood her ground.</p>
<p>For a minute Bissell looked at her out of dull,
hurt eyes. Then he motioned toward the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go in,&#8221; he said gently; &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to see
yuh.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>THE HEATHEN CHINEE</h3>
</div>

<p>Hard-winter Sims, lying at full length
on the grass, indulging in another of his
frequent siestas, was rudely awakened by one of his
herders.</p>
<p>&#8220;More sheep they come,&#8221; said the man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Great Michaeljohn!&#8221; swore Sims, heaving his
long length erect. &#8220;More?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; it is Rubino with the third flock.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sims cast a practiced eye over the sides of the
swelling hills, where already two thousand animals,
the second consignment, were feeding. It was
now a week since he had met Bud Larkin after
the stampede, and he was worried over the non-appearance
of his chief. Here, in the hills of the
southern hook of the Big Horn Mountains, he had
fed the second flock up one valley and down the
next, waiting for Larkin&#8217;s arrival or some word
from him.</p>
<p>Hurrying south after that midnight meeting,
he had reached his destination just in time to check
the advance of the second two thousand that had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
come the night before. Knowing the hard march
north, but ignorant of the conditions now prevailing
on the Bar T range, he had hesitated to
expose more of Larkin&#8217;s animals to ruin.</p>
<p>The arrival of this third flock complicated matters
in the extreme, since the feeding-ground became
constantly farther away from the original
rendezvous.</p>
<p>He looked in the direction indicated by the
herder and saw the cloud of dust that betokened
the advance of the new flock. Soon the tinkle
of the bells and the blethering of the animals themselves
reached him, and he started leisurely back
to meet Rubino.</p>
<p>He found the sheep in good physical shape, for
they had been traveling at a natural pace, a condition
not always easily brought about, and totally
dependent on the skill of the herder. If the dogs
or men follow constantly behind the animals, they,
feeling that they are being constantly urged, will
go faster and faster, neglecting to crop, and so
starve on their feet in the midst of abundant
feed. For this reason herders often walk slowly
ahead of their flock, holding them back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are the next two thousand?&#8221; Sims
asked Rubino.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two days behind, and coming slowly.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And the last?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Three days behind them, but farther to the
east.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sims whistled. He realized that in five days,
if nothing were done, he would have eight thousand
sheep on his hands, scattered over the hills
in every direction and subject to heavy loss both
by wild animals and straying.</p>
<p>With the aplomb of a general disposing his
forces, Sims indicated the rising hill on which
Rubino should bed his flock down, and watched
critically as they went through this evolution.</p>
<p>Sheep are the most unresponsive to human affection
of any domesticated animal. Never, in all
the thousands of years of shepherding, have they
come to recognize man as an integer. They still
cling to the flock life. Even when attacked by
wild animals at night they do not seek the shepherd,
but stand and bawl to the valiant (?) rams to beat
off the enemy. On the march, the dogs do the
actual herding, so that the &#8220;muttons&#8221; do not look
to man for their orders.</p>
<p>The only occasion that they appeal to a human
being is when their bodies crave salt. Then they
run to him with a peculiar guttural cry, and, having
been supplied, forget the herder immediately.
Some people have tried to prove that this trait
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
predicates a recognition of the human being as
such, but it seems far more likely that they regard
him with the same indifference as a giver that
they do the water-hole which quenches their thirst.</p>
<p>Without intelligence, or the direct appreciation
of man, they are entirely unattractive, ranking far
below the dog, horse, or even cow. Consequently
but few men in the sheep business have any affection
for them. Of these few, Hard-winter Sims
was probably the leader. Something closely akin
to a maternal obligation was constantly at work in
him, and the one thing that brought instant response
was the cry of distress of a lamb or ewe.</p>
<p>Now, as Rubino&#8217;s flock dotted itself over the
hillside in the sunset, Sims watched what was to
him the most beautiful thing in the world. The
sounds were several&mdash;the mothering mutter of
the ewes, the sharp blat of some lamb skipping
for dinner, the plaintive cries of the &#8220;grannies&#8221;&mdash;wethers
who, through some perverted maternal
instinct, seek to mother some stray lamb as their
own&mdash;and the deeper, contented throating of the
rams.</p>
<p>The dogs, panting and thirsty with the long
day&#8217;s march, saw that their charges were finally
settled, except for the few lone sentinels against
the cobalt sky. Then they trotted with lolling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
tongues to the little stream that trickled down the
valley and waded in to drink. After that they
sought out their masters and sat beside them with
pricked ears, wondering why no preparations for
supper were going forward.</p>
<p>To the herders after the long trail the luxury
of a cook wagon was appreciated. Only the first
and last detachments carried one, and Rubino&#8217;s men
had cooked their meals over tiny fires made in the
barren places, as the herdsmen have done since
time immemorial.</p>
<p>The cook, a sullen man at best, grumbled audibly
at the increase of his duties. Where before he
had cooked for six men, now he must cook and
clean up for twelve. All things considered, it was
a &#8220;helluva&#8221; note, he declared, until Sims, overhearing
his remarks, booted him a couple of times
around the cook wagon, so that he much preferred
the arduous duties of his calling.</p>
<p>&#8220;If yuh could only make every man love his
job by contrast with somethin&#8217; else a lot worse,
what a peaceful world this would be,&#8221; thought
Sims. &#8220;Now, sheep-herdin&#8217; ain&#8217;t so plumb gentle
yuh could call it a vacation, but when I think of
cows an&#8217; a round-up I shore do bless them old
blackfaces for bein&#8217; alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finally the long-drawn yell of the cook gave
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
notice that the meal was ready and all hands fell
to with a will. They had hardly got started, however,
when there came a sound of galloping feet
from the north that brought them all upstanding
and reaching for their weapons.</p>
<p>Over a near-by hill swept a body of perhaps
fifty horsemen, each with a rifle across his saddle
and a revolver at hip. They were typical plainsmen,
and as the last radiance of the sun lighted
them up, Sims could see that they wore the regular
broad-brimmed white Stetsons of the cattle men.</p>
<p>&#8220;Put down yore guns, boys,&#8221; said Sims after
a moment&#8217;s thought. &#8220;Let&#8217;s get out o&#8217; this
peaceable if we can.&#8221;</p>
<p>The men put away their weapons and waited in
silence. The horsemen swept up at the tireless
trot of the plains until they recognized the tall,
gaunt figure of the chief herdsman. Then, with a
yell, they galloped into camp, drew rein abruptly,
and dismounted.</p>
<p>Sims recognized the leader as Jimmie Welsh,
the foreman of Larkin&#8217;s Montana sheep ranch, and
a happy, contented grin spread over his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glory be, boys!&#8221; he yelled, going forward to
meet the horsemen. &#8220;Rustle around there, cookee,&#8221;
he called back over his shoulder, &#8220;yuh got
company fer supper!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></p>
<p>The riders after their long journey were only
too glad to see a permanent camp, and dismounted
with grunts of pleasure and relief. They had
come a distance of nearly two hundred and fifty
miles in four days, and their horses were no longer
disposed to pitch when their riders got upon them
in the morning. The party was composed of all
the available men from Larkin&#8217;s ranch and others
from the neighboring places.</p>
<p>In these men the hatred of cowmen and their
ways was even more intense than <i>vice versa</i>, this
being a result, no doubt, of the manifold insults
they had suffered, and the fact that, as a rule, cowboys
far outnumber sheep-herders and run them off
the country at will. The call to arms taken north
by Miguel had met with instant and enthusiastic
response, and these men had come south to wipe
out in one grand mêlée their past disgraces.</p>
<p>During supper Sims told of Larkin&#8217;s offer of
five dollars a day, and the riders nodded approvingly;
it was the customary hire of fighting men in
the range wars.</p>
<p>&#8220;But how did you get down over the Bar T
range?&#8221; asked the chief herder.</p>
<p>&#8220;We done that at night,&#8221; replied Jimmie Welsh,
who was a little man with a ruddy face, bright
eyes and a crisp manner of speech. &#8220;Tell me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
what&#8217;s that ungodly mess up in Little River; it
was night an&#8217; we couldn&#8217;t see?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two thousand of Larkin&#8217;s sheep,&#8221; replied Sims,
laconically, and an angry murmur ran through
the men. &#8220;Old Bissell, of the Bar T, stampeded
&#8217;em when we were just a-goin&#8217; to get &#8217;em through
safe. Shot up one herder, lammed cookee over
the head an&#8217; raised ructions generally. Yes, boys,
I&#8217;m plumb shore we have one or two little matters
to ask them Bar T punchers about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what&#8217;s your orders, Simmy?&#8221; asked
Welsh.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in charge o&#8217; the hull outfit till the boss
shows up an&#8217; can do whatever I want. I&#8217;m gettin&#8217;
real concerned about him though, not hearin&#8217; a
word for a week. I &#8217;low if he don&#8217;t turn up to-morrow
I&#8217;ll have to send you boys lookin&#8217; fer him.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the morrow brought its own solution of the
problem.</p>
<p>In the middle of the morning a lone horseman
was seen approaching over the hills, and the restless
sheepmen, eager for any sport, spread out
into a veritable ambuscade, taking position behind
rocks and in depressions along the hills on either
hand.</p>
<p>The horseman was very evidently a poor rider,
for, instead of holding the reins easily and jauntily
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
in his upturned right hand, he was clinging to the
pommel of the saddle, while the pony slipped and
slid along the difficult path.</p>
<p>Within a furlong of the camp, the man&#8217;s
nationality was made apparent by the flapping shirt
and trousers he wore, as well as the black, coarse
cue that whipped from side to side.</p>
<p>Among the secreted sheepmen a grin spread
from face to face at the sight of this distressful
figure, evidently in real wo from hours in the
hard saddle. About a hundred yards from camp
a single shot rang out, and then there arose such
a wild chorus of reports and yells as would have
terrified a stone image.</p>
<p>The cow pony (which of all horses loathes a bad
rider) showed the whites of his eyes wickedly, laid
his ears back into his mane and bucked madly
with fright. The Chinaman, chattering like a
monkey, described a perfect parabola and alighted
right side up on the only tuft of grass within ten
yards.</p>
<p>In an instant he bounced to his feet, took one
look at the surrounding society, and made a bolt
for the cook-wagon, the one place that was familiar
to him.</p>
<p>At the door he encountered the sheepmen&#8217;s
regular cook coming out to see what the trouble
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
was, and the next moment witnessed the near-annihilation
of the yellow peril.</p>
<p>Sims and Jimmie Welsh pulled the burly cook
off in time to save the Oriental, and the latter sat
up with a dazed, frightened air.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yah! Makee much damee hellee!&#8221; he announced.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too much damee hellee,&#8221; said Sims sententiously.
&#8220;John, you good fighter. Me like you.
What you do here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me bling message,&#8221; and he reached into his
blouse and drew out a piece of paper folded and
pinned.</p>
<p>This he handed to Sims, who promptly opened it
and started to read. In a minute he stopped and
yelled for everyone who was not in the immediate
circle to gather round and listen. Then,
haltingly, he read aloud the following:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Sims:</span></p>
<p>Ah Sin who brings you this is a bang-up cook, and I am
sending him to you to get a job. Pay him fifty dollars on the
spot in advance for his first month. I told him you would.
He was the Bar T cook, I am sorry to say, but there was no
other way of getting a message to you than to send him.</p>
<p>For the last few days I have been a prisoner in the &#8220;guest
room&#8221; of the Bar T ranch-house. This is the middle room
on the northwest side. After a certain row here I was clapped
into confinement, and the Chinaman had to do the honors for
me at all meals. I got friendly with him and found he was
getting only thirty a month.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></p>
<p>When he told me he owned one of the horses in the corral
the whole thing was easy. I offered him fifty, gave him exact
directions how to find your camp, and told him the best time
to start.</p>
<p>If he ever reaches you, you will know where I am, and I
want some of you to come and get me out of this. The cattlemen
from all over are here, and they accuse me of standing in
with the rustlers. What will happen to me I don&#8217;t know, but
I&#8217;m sure of this, it won&#8217;t be healthy.</p>
<p>I should think the boys would be down from the north by
this time.</p>
<p>Now, Simmy, keep everything under your hat and work
quietly. Let the sheep pile up if you have to. Things aren&#8217;t
ripe here yet to move &#8217;em north.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be looking for you any day.</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style='margin-right:2em;'><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Bud</span>. </p>
</div>

</div>
<p>When Sims had read the entire note twice, a
puzzled silence ensued. Men lifted their hats
and scratched their heads meditatively. Here
among fifty men there was plenty of energy for
action once the action was suggested, but very
little initiative.</p>
<p>&#8220;I allow we&#8217;ll shore have to get &#8217;im out o&#8217;
there,&#8221; seemed to be the consensus of opinion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shore, boys, shore,&#8221; said Sims impatiently;
&#8220;but how? That&#8217;s the question. There&#8217;s about
a dozen real smart shooters on that ranch, and
I&#8217;m plenty sure they don&#8217;t all sleep to once. Besides,
the worst part of it&#8217;ll be gettin&#8217; near the
dum place. If a hoss squeals or whinnies the
rescuin&#8217; party might as well pick out their graves,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
&#8217;cause yuh see only two or three can make the
trip.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe they can an&#8217; mebbe they can&#8217;t,&#8221; broke
in Jimmie Welsh, his little, bright eyes twinkling
with suppressed merriment. &#8220;I should think the
hull outfit, cook-wagons, an&#8217; all, could make the
visit to the Bar T.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah?&#8221; remarked Sims politely scornful but
inquisitive. &#8220;Tell us about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Welsh did.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>SENTENCED</h3>
</div>

<p>Everybody at the Bar T ranch house was
laboring under suppressed excitement. It
was now the middle of June when the yearly
round-up should be under way, yet, owing to the
invasion of the sheep and the recent rustler troubles,
the cowboys had not been free to undertake
this task.</p>
<p>On other ranches this spring work was well advanced,
and the fact that the Bar T had not yet
begun was a source of constant worry to Bissell
and Stelton. The former, when he had sent out
his call for other cowmen of the region, had encountered
great difficulty in getting his neighbors
to give up their time to the disposal of Bud Larkin&#8217;s
case.</p>
<p>At last, however, ten owners, impatient at the
summons and anxious to return as quickly as possible
to their work, had ridden in, some of them
alone and others with a cowboy taken from the
round-up.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></p>
<p>Since the Bar T ranch house was incapable of
accommodating them all, the punchers had been
ousted from their bunk-house and the structure
given over to the visitors.</p>
<p>The sudden disappearance of the Chinese cook
had added to Bissell&#8217;s troubles and shamed the
hospitality of his home. This situation had been
relieved temporarily by the labors of Mrs. Bissell
and Juliet until an incompetent cowboy had been
pressed into service at an exorbitant figure.</p>
<p>Therefore it was with short temper and less
patience that Bissell began what might be called
the trial of Larkin. The meeting-place of the
men was under a big cottonwood that stood by the
bank of the little stream curving past the Bar T.</p>
<p>As each man arrived from his home ranch he
was made acquainted with the situation as it stood,
and one afternoon Larkin was brought out from
his room to appear before the tribunal. The
owners were determined to end the matter that
day, mete out punishment, and ride back to their
own ranches in the morning.</p>
<p>It was a circle of stern-faced, solemn men that
Larkin faced under the cottonwood tree, and as
he looked at one after another, his heart sank,
for there appeared very little of the quality of
mercy in any of them. Knowing as he did the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
urgency that was drawing them home again, he
feared that the swiftness of judgment would be
tempered with very little reason.</p>
<p>Bissell as head of the organization occupied a
chair, while at each side of him five men lounged
on the grass, their guns within easy reach. Larkin
was assigned to a seat facing them all, and, looking
them over, recognized one or two. There
was Billy Speaker, of the Circle-Arrow, whom he
had once met, and Red Tarken, of the M Square,
unmistakable both because of his size and his flaming
hair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Larkin,&#8221; began Bissell, &#8220;these men
know what you&#8217;ve been tryin&#8217; to do to my
range&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do they know what you did to my sheep?&#8221;
interrupted Bud crisply.</p>
<p>Bissell&#8217;s face reddened at this thrust, for, deep
down, he knew that the stampede was an utterly
despicable trick, and he was not over-anxious to
have it paraded before his neighbors, some of
whom had ridden far at his request.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut yore mouth,&#8221; he snarled, &#8220;an&#8217; don&#8217;t yuh
open it except to answer questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, yuh can&#8217;t do that, Bissell,&#8221; and blond
Billy Speaker shook his head. &#8220;Yuh got to give
&#8217;im a chance to defend himself. Now we&#8217;re here
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
we want to get all the facts. What did yuh do
to his sheep, Beef? I never heard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I run a few of &#8217;em into the Little River, if
yore any happier knowin&#8217;,&#8221; snapped Bissell, glowering
on Speaker.</p>
<p>Larkin grinned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two thousand of &#8217;em,&#8221; he volunteered.
There was no comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;These gents know,&#8221; went on Bissell, after a
short pause, &#8220;that yuh were two days with them
rustlers and that yuh can tell who they are if yuh
will. Now will yuh tell us how you got in with
&#8217;em in the first place?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bud began at the time of the crossing of the
Big Horn and with much detail described how he
had outwitted the Bar T punchers with the hundred
sheep under Pedro, while the rest of the
flock went placidly north. His manner of address
was good, he talked straightforwardly, and with
conviction and, best of all, had a broad sense of
humor that vastly amused these cowmen.</p>
<p>Sympathetic though they were with Bissell&#8217;s
cause, Larkin&#8217;s story of how a despised sheepman
had outwitted the cattle-king brought grins
and chuckles.</p>
<p>&#8220;I allow yuh better steer clear o&#8217; them sheep,
Bissell,&#8221; suggested one man drolly. &#8220;First thing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
yuh know this feller&#8217;ll tell yuh he&#8217;s bought the
Bar T away from yuh without yore knowin&#8217; it.
Better look up yore land grant to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>By this time Bissell had become a caldron of
seething rage. His hand actually itched to grab
his gun and teach Larkin a lesson. But his position
as chairman of the gathering prevented this,
although he knew that plains gossip was being
made with every word spoken. Among the cowmen
about him were some whose ill success or
smaller ranches had made them jealous, and, in
his mind, he could see them retailing with much
relish what a fool Larkin had made of him. He
knew he would meet with reminders of this trial
during the rest of his life.</p>
<p>However, he stuck to his guns.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now what we want to know, young feller, is
this: the names an&#8217; descriptions of them rustlers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will give them to you gladly and will supply
men to help run them down at my own expense
if you will let the rest of my sheep come north on
your range. Not only that, but I will not ask any
damages for the animals you have already killed.
Now, men,&#8221; Larkin added, turning to the others
and with a determined ring in his voice, &#8220;I want
peace. This fighting is cutting our own throats
and we are losing money by the hour.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The range is free, as all of you know; there
is a law against fencing it, and that means that no
grangers can settle here and make it pay&mdash;the
animals would eat all their unfenced farm truck.
I have a ranch in Montana with about three thousand
sheep on it. I tried to buy more there, but
couldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>&#8220;Therefore, I had to come down south and
&#8217;walk&#8217; them north. Now I don&#8217;t like to fight
anybody, chiefly because it costs too much; but in
a case like this, when I find a dog in the manger&#8221;&mdash;he
looked directly at Bissell&mdash;&#8220;I make it a
principle to kick that dog out of the manger and
use it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am just as much of an American as any of
you, and Americans never had a habit of letting
other people walk all over them. Now you men
can do anything with me you want&mdash;I can&#8217;t prevent
you. But I can warn you that if I am judged
in any way it will be the worst job the cowmen of
Wyoming ever did.</p>
<p>&#8220;Understand, this isn&#8217;t a threat, it&#8217;s just a
statement. Because I refuse to turn in and help
that man, who has done his best to ruin me, he
wants me to suffer the same penalty as a criminal.
Now I leave it to you. Has he much of a
case?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></p>
<p>Bud, who had risen in the fervor of his speech,
sat down and looked at his hearers. Never in his
life had he pleaded for anything, but in this moment
necessity had made him eloquent. He had
hardly taken his seat when Mike Stelton strolled
over and sat down on the grass.</p>
<p>For a few minutes there was silence as the men,
slow of thought, revolved what Larkin had said.
Bissell, ill-concealing his impatience, awaited their
comments anxiously. At last Billy Speaker remarked:</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see your bellyache at all, Bissell. It
seems to me you&#8217;ve acted pretty ornery.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have, eh?&#8221; roared Beef, stung by this cool
opinion. &#8220;Would yuh let sheep go up yore
range? Tell me that, would yuh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I allow I might manage,&#8221; was the contemptuous
retort. &#8220;They&#8217;re close feeders on the march,
an&#8217; don&#8217;t spread out noways far.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bissell choked with fury, but subsided when another
man spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;I figure we&#8217;re missin&#8217; the point, fellers,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;This here association of our&#8217;n was made
for the purpose of doin&#8217; just what Bissell has been
tryin&#8217; to do&mdash;that is, keep the range clear for the
cows. We don&#8217;t care what it is that threatens,
whether it&#8217;s sheep, or wolves, or rustlers, or prairie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
fires. This association is supposed to pertect the
cows.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I &#8217;low that Mr. Larkin has had his
troubles right enough, but that&#8217;s his fault. You
warned him in time. I&#8217;m plumb regretful he&#8217;s lost
his sheep, but that don&#8217;t let him out of tellin&#8217; us
where them rustlers are. It&#8217;s a pretty mean cuss
that&#8217;ll cost us thousands of dollars a year just for
spite or because he can&#8217;t drive a hard bargain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Up on my place I&#8217;ve lost a hundred calves
already, but I&#8217;d be mighty glad to lose a hundred
more if I could see the dirty dogs that stole &#8217;em
kickin&#8217; from a tree-limb. An&#8217; I&#8217;m in favor of a
tree-limb for anybody who won&#8217;t tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yore shore gettin&#8217; some long-winded, Luby,&#8221;
remarked a tall man who smoked a pipe, &#8220;an&#8217;
likewise yore angry passions has run away with
yore sense. Yuh can&#8217;t string a man up because
he won&#8217;t talk; &#8217;cause if yuh do we&#8217;ll sick the deputy
sheriff on yuh an&#8217; mebbe you&#8217;ll go to jail.&#8221;</p>
<p>The speaker rolled a droll, twinkling eye at
Bissell and the whole gathering burst into a great
guffaw at his expense. This was all the more effective
since Bissell had decorated the outside of his
vest with the nickel-plated star of his authority.</p>
<p>At this sally he nearly had apoplexy and bawled
out for a drink, which somebody accommodatingly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
supplied from a flask, although such things were
rarely carried.</p>
<p>When the merriment had subsided a fourth man
volunteered the opinion that, although there was
nothing that could force Bud to tell what he knew,
still, such a defiance of their organization should
not go unpunished. The fact that the cowmen
were opposed to the entrance of sheep into the territory
was enough excuse, he thought, to make an
example of Bud Larkin and thus keep other ambitious
sheepmen away from the range in this
section.</p>
<p>One after another of the men gave their opinions
and finally lined up in two camps, the first
resolved on punishing Larkin in some manner, and
the second in favor of letting him go with a warning
that he must take the consequences if he ever
attempted to walk any more sheep over the Bar T
range or any other range of the association.</p>
<p>As has been said, the right of justice and fair-dealing
was the very backbone of the cattle-raising
industry, and owners depended almost entirely
upon other men&#8217;s recognition of it to insure them
any profits in the fall.</p>
<p>For this reason six of the eleven men were in
favor of letting Larkin go. The matter rested
with the majority vote and was about to be put to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
the final ballot when Mike Stelton got on his feet
and asked if he might put a few questions.</p>
<p>Bissell, only too eager for any delay or interruption
that might change the sentiment of the majority,
granted the request.</p>
<p>Stelton&#8217;s dark face was illumined for a moment
with a crafty smile, and then he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yuh know a man by the name of Smithy
Caldwell, don&#8217;t yuh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Bud, cautiously, not seeing quite
where the question might lead.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was in that stampede with yuh, wasn&#8217;t
he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was one of the party sent out to string
yuh up, wasn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>This time there was a long hesitation as Bud
tried vainly to catch the drift of the other&#8217;s interrogation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered slowly at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, he must have been one of the
rustlers,&#8221; cried Stelton in a triumphant voice, turning
to the rest of the men, who were listening
intently.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, I admit it,&#8221; remarked Larkin
coolly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see where that is taking you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just keep yore shirt on an&#8217; yuh will in a minute,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
retorted Stelton. &#8220;Now just one or two
more questions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you remember the first night Caldwell
came to the Bar T ranch?&#8221;</p>
<p>Larkin did not answer. A premonition that he
was in the toils of this man concerning that dark
thing in his past life smote him with a chill of
terror. He remembered wondering that very
night whether or not Stelton had been listening to
his talk with Caldwell. Then the recollection suddenly
came to him that, even though he had heard,
the foreman could not expose the thing that was
back of it all. Once more he regained his
equilibrium.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I remember that night,&#8221; he said calmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221; snapped Stelton, his words like
pistol-shots. &#8220;Then yuh remember that Smithy
Caldwell got five hundred dollars from yuh after a
talk by the corral, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Larkin, in immense relief that
Stelton had not mentioned the blackmail.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, gents,&#8221; cried the foreman with
the air of a lawyer making a great point, &#8220;yuh
have the admission from Larkin that he gave
money secretly to one of the rustlers. If that
ain&#8217;t connivance and ackchul support I&#8217;m a longhorn
heifer.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></p>
<p>He sat down on the grass triumphantly.</p>
<p>It seemed to Bud Larkin as though some
gigantic club had descended on the top of his
head and numbed all his senses. Careful as he had
been, this wily devil had led him into a labyrinthic
maze of questions, the end of which was a concealed
precipice. And, like one of his own sheep,
he had leaped over it at the leader&#8217;s call!</p>
<p>He looked at the faces of his judges. They
were all dark now and perplexed. Even Billy
Speaker seemed convinced. Bud admitted to
himself that his only chance was to refute Stelton&#8217;s
damaging inference. But how?</p>
<p>The cowmen were beginning to talk in low tones
among themselves and there was not much time.
Suddenly an idea came. With a difficult effort he
controlled his nervous trepidation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Men,&#8221; he said, &#8220;Stelton did not pursue his
questions far enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What d&#8217;yuh mean by that?&#8221; asked Bissell,
glaring at him savagely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean that he did not ask me what Caldwell
actually did with the money I gave him. He
made you believe that Smithy used it for the rustlers
with my consent. That is a blamed lie!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did he do with it?&#8221; cried Billy Speaker.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask Stelton,&#8221; shouted Bud, suddenly leaping
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
out of his chair and pointing an accusing finger at
the foreman. &#8220;He seems to know so much about
everything, ask him!&#8221;</p>
<p>The foreman, dazed by the unexpected attack,
turned a surprised and harrowed countenance toward
the men as he scrambled to his feet. He
cast quick, fearful glances in Larkin&#8217;s direction,
as though attempting to discover how much of certain
matters that young man actually knew.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask him!&#8221; repeated Bud emphatically.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a fine man to listen to, coming here with
a larkum story that he can&#8217;t follow up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, Stelton, loosen yore jaw,&#8221; suggested
Billy Speaker. &#8220;What did this here Caldwell do
with the money?&#8221;</p>
<p>Stelton, his face black with a cloud of rage and
disappointment, glared from one to another of
the men, who were eagerly awaiting his replies.
Larkin, watching him closely, saw again those
quick, furtive flicks of the eye in his direction, and
the belief grew upon him that Stelton was suspicious
and afraid of something as yet undreamed
of by the rest. Larkin determined to remember
the fact.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what he done with the money,&#8221;
growled the foreman at last, admitting his defeat.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you give Caldwell five hundred in
the first place, Larkin?&#8221; asked Bissell suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a matter between himself and me
only,&#8221; answered Bud freezingly, while at the
same time he sat in fear and trembling that Stelton
would leap before the cowmen at this new
cue and retail all the conversation of that night
at the corral.</p>
<p>But for some reason the foreman let the opportunity
pass and Bud wondered to himself what
this sudden silence might mean.</p>
<p>He knew perfectly well that no gentle motive
was responsible for the fellow&#8217;s attitude, and wrote
the occurrence down on the tablets of his memory
for further consideration at a later date.</p>
<p>After this there was little left to be done.
Stelton&#8217;s testimony had failed in its chief purpose,
to compass the death of Larkin, but it had not
left him clear of the mark of suspicion and he himself
had little idea of absolute acquittal. Under
the guard of his sharpshooting cow-puncher he
was led back to his room in the ranch house to
await the final judgment.</p>
<p>In an hour it was delivered to him, and in all
the history of the range wars between the sheep
and cattle men there is recorded no stranger sentence.
In a land where men were either guilty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
or innocent, and, therefore, dead or alive, it stands
alone.</p>
<p>It was decided by the cowmen that, as a warning
and example to other sheep owners, Bud
Larkin should be tied to a tree and quirted, the
maximum of the punishment being set at thirty
blows and the sentence to be carried out at dawn.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>COWLAND TOPSY-TURVY</h3>
</div>

<p>To Bud Larkin enough had already happened
to make him as philosophical as Socrates.
Epictetus remarks that our chief happiness should
consist in knowing that we are entirely indifferent
to calamity; that disgrace is nothing if our
consciences are right and that death, far from
being a calamity is, in fact, a release.</p>
<p>But the world only boasts of a few great
minds capable of believing these theories, and
Larkin&#8217;s was not one of them. He was distinctly
and completely depressed at the prospect ahead
of him.</p>
<p>It was about ten o&#8217;clock at night and he sat
in the chair beside his table, upon which a candle
was burning, running over the pages of an ancient
magazine.</p>
<p>The knowledge of what the cowmen had decided
to do with him had been brought by a committee
of three of the men just before the supper
hour and since that time Larkin had been fuming
and growling with rage.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></p>
<p>There seems to be something particularly
shameful in a whipping that makes it the most
dreaded of punishments. It was particularly so
at the time in which this story is laid, for echoes of
&#8217;65 were still to be heard reverberating from one
end of the land to the other. In the West whippings
were of rare occurrence, if not unknown,
except in penitentiaries, where they had entirely
too great a vogue.</p>
<p>Larkin&#8217;s place of captivity was now changed.
Some enterprising cowboy, at Bissell&#8217;s orders, had
fashioned iron bars and these were fixed vertically
across the one window. The long-unused lock
of the door had been fitted with a key and other
bars fastened across the doorway horizontally so
that should Larkin force the lock he would still
meet opposition.</p>
<p>Since Juliet&#8217;s unpleasant episode with her father
Bud had seen her just once&mdash;immediately
afterward. Then, frankly and sincerely, she had
told him what had happened and why, and Larkin,
touched to the heart, had pleaded with her
for the greatest happiness of his life.</p>
<p>The realization of their need for each other
was the natural outcome of the position of each,
and the fact that, whatever happened, Juliet found
herself forced to espouse Bud&#8217;s cause.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></p>
<p>In that interview with her father she had come
squarely to the parting of the ways, and had
chosen the road that meant life and happiness to
her. The law that human intellects will seek
their own intellectual level, providing the person
is sound in principle, had worked out in her case,
and, once she had made her decision, she clung
to it with all the steadfastness of a strong and
passionate nature.</p>
<p>It was Bissell&#8217;s discovery of a new and intimate
relation between his daughter and the sheepman
that had resulted in the latter&#8217;s close confinement,
and from the time that this occurred the
two had seen nothing of each other except an occasional
glimpse at a distance when Bud was taken
out for a little exercise.</p>
<p>To-night, therefore, as Larkin sat contemplating
the scene to be enacted at dawn, his sense
of shame increased a hundredfold, for he knew
that, as long as she lived, Julie could not forget
the occurrence.</p>
<p>It should not be thought that all this while he
had not formulated plans of escape. Many had
come to him, but had been quickly dismissed as
impracticable. Day and night one of the Bar T
cowboys watched him. And even though he had
been able to effect escape from his room, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
knew that without a horse he was utterly helpless
on the broad, level stretches of prairie. And to
take a horse from the Bar T corral would lay him
open to that greatest of all range crimes&mdash;horse-stealing.</p>
<p>To-night his guards had been doubled. One
paced up and down outside his window and the
other sat in the dining-room on which his door
opened.</p>
<p>Now, at ten o&#8217;clock the entire Bar T outfit was
asleep. Since placing the bunk-house at the disposal
of the cowmen from other ranches, the
punchers slept on the ground&mdash;rolled in their
blankets as they always did when overtaken by
night on the open range.</p>
<p>At ten-thirty Bud put out his candle, undressed,
and went to bed. But he could not sleep. His
mind reverted to Hard-winter Sims and the sheep
camp by the Badwater. He wondered whether
the men from Montana had arrived there yet,
and, most intensely of all, he wondered whether
Ah Sin had got safely through with his message.</p>
<p>He calculated that the Chinaman must have arrived
three days before unless unexpectedly delayed,
and he chafed at the apparent lack of effort
made on his behalf. The only explanation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
that offered itself was&mdash;that Sims, taking advantage
of the events happening at the Bar T, had
seized the opportunity to hurry the gathering
sheep north across the range. If such was the
case, Larkin resigned himself to his fate, since
he had given Sims full power to do as he thought
best.</p>
<p>At about midnight he was dimly conscious of
a scuffling sound outside his window, and, getting
softly out of bed, went to the opening. In
a few minutes the head of a man rose gradually
above the window-sill close to the house, and a
moment later he was looking into the face of
Hard-winter Sims.</p>
<p>Controlling the shock this apparition gave him,
Larkin placed his finger on his lips and whispered
in a tone so low it was scarcely more than
a breath:</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you get the fellow outside?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sims nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s another one in the dining-room just
outside my door. He ought to be relieved at one
o&#8217;clock, but he&#8217;ll have to go out and wake up
his relief. He&#8217;ll go out the kitchen door, and
when he does nab him, but don&#8217;t let him yell.
Now pass me a gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without a sound, Sims inserted a long .45 between
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
the clumsy bars, and followed it with a
cartridge belt.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;ll we get yuh out?&#8221; he whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;After fixing the man inside come out again
and loosen these bars; the door is barred, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are the cowmen?&#8221; asked Sims.</p>
<p>&#8220;All in the bunk-house, and the punchers are
sleeping out near the corral.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I seen &#8217;em. Now you go back to bed
an&#8217; wait till I hiss through the window. Then
we&#8217;ll have yuh out o&#8217; here in a jiffy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The herder&#8217;s form vanished in the darkness,
and Larkin, his heart beating high with hope and
excitement, returned to his bed. Before lying
down, however, he dressed himself completely
and strapped on the cartridge belt and gun.</p>
<p>The minutes passed like hours. Listening with
every nerve fiber on the alert, Bud found the night
peopled with a multitude of sounds that on an
ordinary occasion would have passed unnoticed.
So acute did his sense of hearing become that the
crack of a board in the house contracting under
the night coolness seemed to him almost like a
pistol shot.</p>
<p>When at last it appeared that Sims must have
failed and that dawn would surely begin to break,
he heard a heavy sound in the dining-room and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
sat bolt upright. It was merely the cow-puncher
there preparing to go out and waken his successor.
Although the man made as little noise as possible,
it seemed to Bud that his footsteps must
wake everybody in the house.</p>
<p>The man went out of the dining-room into the
mess-room of the cowboys, closing the door behind
him softly, and after that what occurred was
out of the prisoner&#8217;s ken.</p>
<p>After a while, however, Bud&#8217;s ears caught the
faintest breath of a hiss at the window, and he
rolled softly out of bed on to the floor in his
stocking feet. Sims was there and another man
with him, and both were prying at the bars of
the window with instruments muffled in cloth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you get him?&#8221; asked Bud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shore! He won&#8217;t wake up for a week, that
feller,&#8221; answered Sims placidly.</p>
<p>For a quarter of an hour the two worked at
the clumsy bars, assisted by Bud from the inside.
At the end of that time two of them came loose
at the lower ends and were bent upward. Then
the combined efforts of the three men were centered
on the third bar, which gave way in a few
minutes.</p>
<p>Handing his boots out first, Larkin crawled
headforemost out of the window and put his arms
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
around the shoulders of his rescuers, resting most
of his weight upon their bent backs. Then they
walked slowly away from the house and Bud&#8217;s
feet and legs came out noiselessly. Still in the
shadow of the walls they set him down and he
drew on his boots.</p>
<p>It was not until then that Sims&#8217;s assistant made
himself known.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, boss,&#8221; he said and took off his broad
hat so that Larkin could see his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jimmie Welsh, by George!&#8221; whispered Bud
joyfully, wringing his hand. &#8220;Did you bring
many of the boys down with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fifty,&#8221; replied the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bully for you! I don&#8217;t know what would
become of me if it weren&#8217;t for you and Hard-winter.&#8221;</p>
<p>As they talked they were moving off toward
the little river that wound past the Bar T house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got a horse for me?&#8221; asked Bud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Sims, &#8220;over here in the bottoms
where the rest of the boys are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you plan to do now?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sims told him and Bud grinned delightedly at
the same time that his face hardened with the
triumph of a revenge about to be accomplished.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s get at it,&#8221; he said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Wait here and I&#8217;ll get the rest of the bunch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hard-winter left them, and in a few minutes
returned with a dozen brawny sheepmen, mostly
recruited from Larkin&#8217;s own ranch in Montana.
When greetings had been exchanged they moved
off quietly toward the ranch-house.</p>
<p>The corral of the Bar T was about fifty yards
back of the cook&#8217;s shanty and as you faced it
had a barn on the right-hand side, where the family
saddle horses were kept in winter, as well as
the small amount of hay that Bissell put up every
year.</p>
<p>To the left of the corral the space was open,
and here the Bar T punchers had made their
camp since leaving their former quarters. The
bunk-house on the other hand stood perhaps fifty
feet forward of the barn. It was toward this
building that the expedition under Sims took its
way.</p>
<p>Silently the rough door swung back on its rawhide
hinges and ten men, with a revolver in each
hand, filed quietly in. Sims and Larkin remained
outside on guard. Presently there was a sound
of muttering and cursing that grew louder. Then
one yell, and the solid thud of a revolver butt
coming in contact with a human skull. After
that there was practically no noise whatever.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span></p>
<p>The men outside watched anxiously, fearful
that the single outcry had raised an alarm. But
there was no sound from either the house or the
cowboys&#8217; camp. Presently Welsh stuck his head
out of the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;How is she? Safe?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, bring &#8217;em out,&#8221; answered Bud, and the
next minute a strange procession issued from the
bunk-house.</p>
<p>The cowmen, gagged, and with their hands
bound behind them, walked single file, accompanied
by one of the sheepmen. Without a word
the line turned in the direction of the river bottoms,
where the rest of the band and the horses
were waiting.</p>
<p>To do this it was necessary to pass behind the
cook-house. Bud leaned over and spoke to Sims.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t we get Bissell in this party? He&#8217;s the
fellow that has made all the trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, Jimmy and I will go in and get him. I
had forgotten all about him.&#8221;</p>
<p>But they were saved the trouble, for just as
they were opposite the cook-house, Larkin saw
a burly form outlined for an instant in the doorway
of the cowboys&#8217; dining-room. With three
bounds he was upon this form and arrived just
in time to seize a hand that was vainly tugging
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
at a revolver strapped on beneath his night
clothes.</p>
<p>Had fortune not tangled Bissell&#8217;s equipment
that night Bud Larkin would have been a dead
man. Snatching off his hat, he smashed it over
the cattle king&#8217;s mouth, and an instant later Bissell,
writhing and struggling, but silent, was being
half-carried out to join his friends.</p>
<p>Matters now proceeded with speed and smoothness.
The prisoners were hurried to where the
remainder of the band awaited them. Then, still
bound and gagged, they were mounted on spare
horses.</p>
<p>Only thirty of Welsh&#8217;s raiders had come on
this trip, the rest remaining to help with the
sheep, but their horses had been brought so that
there might be ample provision for everybody.</p>
<p>With a feeling of being once more at home,
Larkin climbed into a deep saddle, and a wave
of triumph surged over him. He was again free,
and at the head of a band of brave men. He had
the ascendency at last over his misfortune, and
he intended to keep it. Then when everything
was finished he could come back and he would find
Juliet&mdash;</p>
<p>The remembrance of her brought him to a
pause. Must he go away without as much as a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
word from her, the one for whom he cared more
than all the rest of the world? Quietly he dismounted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let Jimmie go on with the prisoners and the
rest of the boys,&#8221; he said to Sims. &#8220;You wait
here with me. I must leave one message.&#8221;</p>
<p>A minute later the cavalcade stole away, following
the winding river bank for a mile before setting
foot on the plain.</p>
<p>Then, with Sims crouching, armed, behind the
nearest protection, Bud Larkin walked softly to
the house. He knew which was her window and
went straight there, finding it open as he had expected.
Listening carefully he heard no sound
from within. Then he breathed the one word,
&#8220;Julie,&#8221; and immediately there came a rustling
of the bed as she rose.</p>
<p>Knowing that she had been awake and was
coming to him, he turned away his eyes until he
felt her strong little hand on his shoulder. Then
he looked up to find her in an overwrap with
her luxuriant hair falling down over her shoulders,
her eyes big and luminously dusky.</p>
<p>&#8220;Darling,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I have heard everything,
and I am so glad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you could have given the alarm at any
time?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God bless your faithful little heart!&#8221; he said
fervently, and, reaching up, drew down her face
to his and kissed her.</p>
<p>It was their second kiss and they both thrilled
from head to foot with this tantalization of the
hunger of their love. All the longing of their
enforced separation seemed to burst the dam that
had held it, and, for a time, they forgot all things
but the living, moving tide of their own love.</p>
<p>At last the girl disengaged herself from his
eager hands, with hot cheeks and bright, flame-lit
eyes. Her breath came fast, and it was a moment
before she could compose herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you going now, Bud?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Back to the sheep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I do anything to help you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can only think of one thing, and that is to
marry me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything in time, sir!&#8221; she reproved him.
&#8220;Get your muttons out of the way and then you
can have me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Larkin groaned. Then he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;If anything comes for me or anybody wants
me, I want you to do as I would do if I were
here. Things are coming to a climax now and I
must know all that goes on. Watch Stelton especially.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
He is crooked somewhere, and I&#8217;m going
to get him if it takes me the rest of my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a loud knock from outside
the girl&#8217;s bedroom door, and they both listened,
hardly daring to breathe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Julie, let me in!&#8221; cried Mrs. Bissell&#8217;s querulous
voice. &#8220;Where&#8217;s your father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Run, dear boy, for your life!&#8221; breathed the
girl.</p>
<p>Larkin kissed her swiftly and hurried back to
the underbrush, where Sims was awaiting him in
an access of temper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Great Michaeljohn, boss!&#8221; he growled as
they rode along the bank, &#8220;ain&#8217;t yuh got no consideration
fer me? From the way yuh go on a
person&#8217;d think yuh were in love with the girl.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>A MESSAGE BY A STRANGE HAND</h3>
</div>

<p>What were the feelings of Mr. Mike
Stelton that dawn had better be imagined
than described. The first he knew of any
calamity was when Mrs. Bissell, unable to find
her husband near the house, shook him frantically
by the shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get up, Mike,&#8221; she cried into his ear.
&#8220;Somethin&#8217;s wrong here. Henry&#8217;s nowhere
around.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dazed with sleep, unable to get the proper focus
on events, the foreman blundered stupidly
about the place searching cursorily, and cursing
the helplessness of Beef Bissell.</p>
<p>Presently he got awake, however, and perceived
that dawn was coming up in the east.
Then he reveled in the delightful anticipation of
what was to occur out under the old cottonwood
along the river bank. Mentally he licked his
chops at the prospect of this rare treat. He intended
if possible to make Juliet witness her
lover&#8217;s degradation.</p>
<p>After vainly hunting some valid excuse for Bissell&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
untimely departure, Stelton thought he
would call the boys, which he did. Then he
turned his attention to the bunk-house, for he
knew the cowmen were in a hurry to get away
and would want to be called early.</p>
<p>&#8220;All out!&#8221; he bawled jovially, thrusting his
head in at the door.</p>
<p>Not a sound came in response. Then for the
first time Stelton had a premonition of trouble.
He walked into the bunk-house and took quick
note of the ten tumbled but empty bunks. Also
of the ten belts and revolvers that hung on wooden
pegs along the wall&mdash;the sign of Western etiquette.</p>
<p>In those days, and earlier, if a man rode by at
meal-time or evening he was your guest. He
might take dinner with his hat on, and get his
knife and fork mixed, but if he hung up his belt
and revolver he was satisfied that all the amenities
had been observed, whether you thought so or
not.</p>
<p>The one other unspoken law was that every
man&#8217;s business was his own business and no questions
were allowed. You might be entertaining
a real bad man like Billy the Kid, and you might
suspect his identity, but you never made inquiries,
and for three reasons.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></p>
<p>The first was, that it was bad plains etiquette;
the second, that if you were mistaken and accused
the wrong man, punishment was sure and
swift; and the third was, that if you were right
the punishment was still surer and swifter, for
an escaping criminal never left any but mute witnesses
behind him.</p>
<p>Looking at these ten indications of good-will
along the bunk-house wall, Stelton&#8217;s alarm was
once more lulled. Perhaps the men had all gone
for a paddle in the stream before breakfast, he
thought. If so, they would take care of themselves,
and turn up when the big bell rang. He
couldn&#8217;t waste any more time this way.</p>
<p>Now to relieve the man who was guarding Larkin
outside the window.</p>
<p>He hurried around the house and came upon
the prone figure of a cow-puncher, rolled close
against the house. The man&#8217;s head was bloody,
his hands were tied behind him, and his
neckerchief had been stuffed into his mouth
and held there by another. He was half-dead
when Stelton, with a cry of surprise, bent over
him and loosened his bonds.</p>
<p>With a prolonged yell the foreman brought all
hands running to him and, giving the hurt man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
into the care of a couple of them, ran along the
house to Bud&#8217;s window. The bent bars showed
how the bird had flown. Stelton was about to
give way to his fury when another cry from the
rear of the cook-house told of the discovery of
the second watchman&#8217;s body, that had lain hidden
in the long grass which grew up against the
walls.</p>
<p>Then didn&#8217;t Stelton curse! Never had he
been so moved to profane eloquence, and never
did he give such rein to it. He cursed everything
in sight, beginning with the ranch house; and he
took that from chimney to cellar, up and down
every line and angle, around the corners and out
to the barn. Then he began on the barn and
wound up with the corral. The cowboys listened
in admiration and delight, interjecting words of
approval now and then.</p>
<p>But once having delivered himself of this relief,
the foreman&#8217;s face set into its customary ugly
scowl, and he snapped out orders to saddle the
horses. Presently a man rode up from the river
bottoms and told of the discovery of many hoof
tracks there, and the place where they had waited
a long while.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got it!&#8221; bawled Stelton, pounding his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
thigh. &#8220;Larkin&#8217;s men have been here and carried
off all the owners. Oh, won&#8217;t there be the deuce
to pay?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he picked out the cowboys who had come
with their bosses and added:</p>
<p>&#8220;Crowd yore grub and ride home like blazes.
Get yore punchers an&#8217; bring grub for a week.
Then we&#8217;ll all meet at the junction of the Big
Horn and Gooseberry Creek. If yuh punchers
like a good job you&#8217;ll get yore owners out o&#8217; this.
And I&#8217;m plumb shore when we get through there
won&#8217;t be a sheepman left in this part of the State.
To-morrer night at Gooseberry!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then was such a scene of hurry and bustle and
excitement as the Bar T had seldom witnessed.
The parting injunctions were to bring extra
horses and plenty of rope, with the accent on the
rope, and a significant look thrown in.</p>
<p>By seven o&#8217;clock, the time that Larkin, bloody,
humiliated and suffering, would already have paid
his penalty, there was scarcely a soul at the Bar
T ranch, for the cowboys had disappeared across
the plains at a hard trot.</p>
<p>The Bar T punchers were sent out on the range
to scour for tracks of the fugitives, but, after following
them some distance from the river bottom,
gave up in despair when a night herder admitted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
that the Bar T horses had been feeding in the
vicinity the night before, thus entangling the
tracks. Meantime the cook was preparing food
for the punchers to carry, guns were being oiled
and overhauled, knives sharpened, and ropes carefully
examined.</p>
<p>Yet as the men went about their duties there
was a kind of dazed, subdued air in all they did,
for it was, indeed, hard to realize that the ranch
owners of nearly a quarter of Wyoming&#8217;s best
range had disappeared into the empty air apparently
without a sound or protest.</p>
<p>The following afternoon the entire Bar T outfit,
excepting a couple of punchers who were
incapacitated from former round-up injuries,
swept out of the yard and headed almost directly
east across the plain.</p>
<p>Julie and her mother watched them go and
waved them farewell, the former with a clutch of
fear at her heart for her lover and the latter in
tears for her husband, thus unconsciously taking
opposite sides in the struggle that they knew must
ensue.</p>
<p>It must not be thought that Juliet had turned
against her father since their final difference.
After her first outbreak against his narrow views
and unjust treatment of Larkin, the old love that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
had been paramount all her life returned, and with
it a kind of pity. She knew that in a man of her
father&#8217;s age his nature could not be made over
immediately, if ever; the habits of a rough lifetime
were too firmly ingrained. But at the same
time there was something gone from the sweet and
intimate affection that had formerly characterized
their relations.</p>
<p>Lovers or married folk who declare for the efficacy
of a quarrel as a renewer of love are wrong
in the last analysis. Loss of control always entails
loss of respect, and fervent &#8220;making up&#8221;
after such an outbreak cannot efface the picture
of anger-distorted features or remove the acid of
bitter words. Thus it was with Juliet and her
love for her father.</p>
<p>As to his safety she was not worried, for she
knew that Bud would not allow any harm to come
to him as he was in command of the men who
had effected the taking-off. What Larkin&#8217;s plans
were she did not fully realize, but she knew this
sudden <i>coup</i> had been executed to further his own
ends in the imperative matter of getting his sheep
north. And of this she finally convinced her
mother, although that lady wept copiously before
the thing was accomplished.</p>
<p>The evening following the departure of Mike
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
Stelton and his punchers was made notable by the
arrival of a man on horseback, who carried across
his saddle a black box, and in thongs at his side
a three-legged standard of yellow wood. His remaining
equipment was a square of black cloth.</p>
<p>Without invitation he turned his dejected animal
into the Bar T corral and made himself at
home for the evening. At the supper table he revealed
his identity and explained his purpose.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Ed Skidmore,&#8221; he announced, &#8220;and I
take photographs. This thing I&#8217;ve got is a camera.&#8221;
He had already mounted the instrument
on his tripod. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been going around from
ranch to ranch and the pictures have been selling
like hot cakes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Juliet, listening, noted that his conversation
was that of a comparatively well-educated man
and that he had none of the characteristic drawl
or accent of the plainsmen. To her a camera was
nothing out of the ordinary, although she had
not seen one since her final return West, but her
mother was vastly interested.</p>
<p>In those days photography was not a matter of
universal luxury as it is now, and the enterprising
Skidmore was practically the first to introduce it
as a money-maker in the widely scattered ranches
of the cow country.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How do yuh sell &#8217;em?&#8221; asked Martha Bissell,
fluttering with the possibilities of the next
morning, the time the young man had set for his
operation. Martha had not been &#8220;took&#8221; since
that far-off trip &#8220;East&#8221; to St. Paul, when she and
Henry had posed for daguerreotypes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Five dollars apiece, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; said Skidmore,
&#8220;and they&#8217;re cheap at the price.&#8221; And they were,
since the cost of something universally desired is
dependent on the supply rather than the demand.</p>
<p>After supper Martha retired to her bedroom to
overhaul her stock of &#8220;swell&#8221; dresses, a stock
that had not been disturbed in fifteen years except
for the spring cleaning and airing. This left
Skidmore and Juliet alone. She civilly invited
him out on the veranda, seeing he was a man of
some quality.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had a queer experience to-day,&#8221; he remarked
after a few commonplaces. &#8220;I was riding to
the Bar T from the Circle-Arrow and was about
twenty miles away, rounding a butte, when a man
rode out to me from some place of concealment.</p>
<p>&#8220;When he reached me he suddenly pulled his
gun and covered me.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Where are you goin&#8217;?&#8217; he said. I told him
I was on my way here and why. He examined
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
my outfit suspiciously and let me go. But first
he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Take this letter to the Bar T and give it to
Miss Bissell.&#8217;&#8221; Skidmore reached inside his
shirt and pulled forth a square envelope, which
he handed to Juliet. &#8220;The whole thing was so
strange,&#8221; the photographer went on, &#8220;that I have
waited until I could see you alone so that I could
tell you about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Juliet, surprised and startled, turned the missive
over in her hands, hopeful that it was a letter
from Bud and yet fearful of something that
she could not explain. When Skidmore had finished
she excused herself and went into her room,
closing the door behind her.</p>
<p>On the envelope was the simple inscription,
&#8220;Miss Bissell,&#8221; written in a crabbed, angular
hand. This satisfied her that the message was
not from Bud, and with trembling fingers she
opened it. Inside was an oblong sheet of paper
filled with the same narrow handwriting. Going
to the window to catch the dying light, she
read:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Miss</span>:</p>
<p>This is to tell yuh that Mr. Larkin who yuh love is already
merried. It ain&#8217;t none of my biznis, but I want yuh to no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
it. An&#8217; that ain&#8217;t all. The U. s. oficers are looking for him
on another charge, tu. Nobody noes this but me an&#8217; yuh, an&#8217;
nobody will as long as the monie keeps comin&#8217; in. If yuh
doant bileeve this, axe him.</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style='margin-right:8em;'>Yurs Truly,</p>
<p style='margin-right:2em;'><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>A Friend.</span></p>
</div>

</div>
<p>In the difficulty of translating the words before
her into logical ideas the full import of the statements
made did not penetrate Juliet&#8217;s mind at
first. When they did she merely smiled a calm,
contemptuous smile.</p>
<p>With the usual fatuous faith of a sweetheart,
she instantly consigned to limbo anything whatever
derogatory to her beloved. Then in full
possession of herself, she returned to the veranda,
where Skidmore was smoking a cigarette.</p>
<p>&#8220;No bad news I hope?&#8221; he asked politely,
scrutinizing her features.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, thanks,&#8221; she replied, laughing a little
unnaturally. &#8220;Not really bad, just disturbing,&#8221;
and they continued their interrupted conversation.</p>
<p>But that night when she was in bed the crude
letters of that missive appeared before her eyes
in lines of fire. Of late the old mystery of Bud&#8217;s
past life had not been much in her thoughts; love,
the obliterator, had successfully wiped away the
last traces of uneasiness that she had felt, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
like all true and good women, she had given him
the priceless treasure of her love, not questioning,
not seeking to discern what he would have shown
her had it seemed right in his mind that she should
see.</p>
<p>But this scrawled letter to-night brought back
with stunning force all the distress and doubts
that had formerly assailed her. She guessed, and
rightly, that Smithy Caldwell was the author of it,
but she could not analyze the motives that had
inspired his pen.</p>
<p>She told herself with fatal logic that if all this
were a lie, Caldwell would not dare write it;
that Larkin had paid this man five hundred dollars
on another occasion not so far gone; and that
it was avowedly a case of impudent blackmail.
She knew, furthermore, that Bud carefully
avoided all references to Caldwell even when she
had brought forward the name, and that in the
conversation overheard by Stelton there had been
mention of someone by the name of Mary.</p>
<p>What if this money were going to another
woman!</p>
<p>The thought overwhelmed her as she lay there,
and she sat up gasping for breath, but in a moment
the eternal defense of the man, inherent in every
woman who loves, came to the rescue, and she told
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
herself vehemently that Bud was honorable, if
nothing else. Then the sentence concerning the
United States officers wanting him on another
charge recurred to her, and she found her defense
punctured at the outset. If he were honorable,
how could it be that the officers were
after him?</p>
<p>In despair at the quandary, but still clinging to
her faith, she fell back on the unanswerable fact
of feminine intuition. Bud <i>seemed</i> good and
true; it was in his eyes, in his voice, in his very
manner. He looked at the world squarely, but
with a kind of patient endurance that bespoke
some deep trouble.</p>
<p>Then for the first time the thought came to
Juliet that perhaps he was shielding someone
else.</p>
<p>But who? And, if so, why did Caldwell write
this letter?</p>
<p>Unable to answer these questions, but confronted

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>A BATTLE IN THE DARK</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Everything ready?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bud Larkin sat his horse beside Hard-winter
Sims and looked back over the white mass
that grew dimmer and dimmer in the dark.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Sims lounged wearily against the
horse&#8217;s shoulder. It had been a hard day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get &#8217;em on the move, then.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sims, without changing his position, called out
to the herders. These in turn spoke to the dogs,
and the dogs began to nip the heels of the leader
sheep, who resented the familiarity with loud blatting
and lowering of heads. But they knew the
futility of resisting these nagging guardians and
started to forge ahead. Other dogs got the middlers
in motion, and still others attended to the
tailers, so that in five minutes from the time Larkin
gave the word the whole immense flock was
crawling slowly over the dry plain.</p>
<p>Eight thousand of them there were; eight thousand
semi-imbecile creatures, unacquainted with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
the obstacles they must encounter or the dangers
they must face before they could be brought to
safety or lost in the attempt. And to guard them
there were nearly seventy men whose fear lay not
in the terrors to be met, but in the sheep themselves:
for there is no such obstacle to a sheep&#8217;s
well-being as the sheep himself.</p>
<p>The last flock had arrived the night before,
well-fed and watered. The preceding six thousand
were in good condition from days and weeks
of comfortable grazing in the hills; all were in
good shape to travel.</p>
<p>In moving them at this time Larkin had seized
the psychological moment.</p>
<p>The disgruntled cattle-owners, under a guard
of ten men, were resting quietly far from anything
resembling excitement in one of the untracked
places among the mesas and scoria buttes. Bud
had ascertained, by spies of his own that scoured
the country, that the great posse of rescuing cowpunchers
had gone safely off on a wild-goose
chase, misled by one of the sheepmen who was unknown
in the country.</p>
<p>For the present, therefore, the range was clear,
and Bud reckoned on its remaining so until the
cattlemen had been rescued from their durance
vile. In such a time the sheep-danger shrank into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
insignificance, and Larkin counted on having his
animals across the Bar T range before the finding
of the cattlemen, after which, of course, the men
would be turned loose with much commiseration
and apology.</p>
<p>Of the seventy men guarding and driving the
sheep not more than thirty were regular herders.
Forty were mounted and belonged to Jimmie
Welsh&#8217;s fighting corps, which was composed
mostly of owners and superintendents from the
north country.</p>
<p>Your usual Western shepherd is not a fighting
man and cases have occurred in the bitter range
wars where a herder has been shot down in cold
blood unable to make a defense because of the
grass growing out of his rifle.</p>
<p>Years alone in the brooding silence of the Sierra
slopes or the obscure valleys of the northern
Rockies take the virulence out of a man and make
him placid and at one with nature. Into his soul
there sinks something of the grandeur of cloud-hooded
peaks, the majesty of limitless horizons
and the colors of sky-blue water and greensward.
With him strife is an unknown thing except for
the strife of wits with another herder who would
attempt to share a succulent mountain meadow.</p>
<p>Common report has it, and such writers as Emerson
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
Hough put it in their books, that a sheep-herder
can scarcely follow his calling for seven
years without going mad. On the other hand,
those who have lived for years among the sheep
declare that they have never seen a sheep-herder
even mentally unbalanced.</p>
<p>Probably both are right, as is usual to a degree
in all discussion; but the fact remained that,
sane or insane, the herder was not a fighting man&mdash;something
had gone out of him. Therefore
in bringing men other than herders south with
him, Jimmie Welsh had shown his cleverness.
To fight riders he had brought riders, and these
men now helped to direct the river of animals
that flowed along over the dry plain.</p>
<p>There were two cook outfits to feed the men,
one of which contained the incomparable Ah Sin,
who had amply revenged himself on the herders
for his warm reception at the camp.</p>
<p>That first night they marched ten miles, and,
as before, found the water-holes polluted by the
cattle which take delight in standing in the mud,
and thus in a dry country work their own destruction
by filling the springs.</p>
<p>The next day the sheep cropped fairly well,
although the sun was terrific and no more water
was discovered. Nightfall found them becoming
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
nervous and uneasy. They milled a long while
before they bedded, and more of them than usual
stood up to watch.</p>
<p>Not a rider had been seen all day. Through
the baking glare there had moved a cloud of suffocating
dust, and under it the thirsting, snorting,
blethering sheep, with the dogs on the edges
and the men farther out at regular intervals along
the line.</p>
<p>After supper some of the men slept, for it was
not planned to start the sheep until midnight, as
they needed the rest, being footsore with long
traveling. It was calculated also that they would
reach the ford at the Big Horn by shortly before
dawn.</p>
<p>But the sheep would have none of it, and moved
and milled uneasily until, in order to save the
lambs that were being crushed in the narrowing
circle, Sims gave the order to resume the march.</p>
<p>The night &#8220;walk&#8221; of sheep is a strange thing.
First, perhaps, rides a shepherd, erect and careless
in his saddle, the red light glowing from the
tip of his cigarette; and beside his horse a collie-dog,
nosing at objects, but always with ears for
the sheep and the voice of his master.</p>
<p>Then come the sheep themselves, with cracking
ankle-joints, clattering feet, muffled blethering,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
a cloud of dust, and the inevitable sheep smell.
Perhaps there is a moon, and then the herders
must watch for racing cloud-shadows that cause
stampedes.</p>
<p>Such was the picture of the Larkin sheep that
night, only there was no moon. They started at
ten, and Sims sent Miguel forward to walk before
them, so they would not exhaust themselves
with too fast traveling. On the move the sheep
seemed more contented.</p>
<p>It was perhaps one o&#8217;clock in the morning that
Larkin, in company with his chief herder, spurred
out far in front of the advancing flock to reconnoiter.
The sheep would be within approaching
distance of the ford in a couple of hours, and
Bud wished everything to be clear for them.</p>
<p>Nearing the Big Horn, Sims suddenly drew up
his horse, motioning Bud to silence. Listening
intently, they heard the voice of a man singing
an old familiar plains song. The two looked at
each other in amazement, for this was one of the
&#8220;hymns&#8221; the cowboys use to still their cattle at
night, the time of the most dreaded stampedes.
It was the universal theory of the cow country
that cattle, particularly on a &#8220;drive,&#8221; should not
be long out of hearing of a human voice.</p>
<p>So the night-watchers, as they rode slowly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
about the herd, sang to the cattle, although some
of the ditties rendered were strong enough to
stampede a herd of kedge-anchors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cows here?&#8221; said Sims. &#8220;What does this
mean, boss?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It means that we&#8217;re beaten to the ford and
will have to hold the sheep back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but who&#8217;s driving now? This is round-up
and branding season.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, but between you and me, Sims,
I&#8217;ll bet a lamb to a calf that the rustlers are running
their big pickings north. There are some
mighty good heads at the top of that crowd, and
they have taken advantage of the deserted range,
just as we have, to drive their critters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By George! You&#8217;ve hit it, boss!&#8221; cried
Sims, slapping his thigh. &#8220;Now, what do yuh
say to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>For a long minute of silence Bud Larkin
thought. Then he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s my chance to get those rustlers and
at the same time benefit myself. There can&#8217;t
be more than a dozen or fifteen of them at the
outside. Ride back to the camp, Simmy, and get
twenty men, the best gun-rollers in the outfit.
Tell anybody that&#8217;s afraid of his hide to stay
away, for the rustlers are top-notch gun-fighters.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But what&#8217;ll yuh do with a thousand cattle on
yore hands?&#8221; demanded Hard-winter in amazement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you that if we get &#8217;em,&#8221; was Bud&#8217;s
reply. &#8220;As I see it, we can&#8217;t do without them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The plan of campaign was somewhat indefinite.
The last intention in the world was to
frighten away the cattle by a grand charge and
a salvo of young artillery. With great caution
the sheepmen approached near enough to discern
the white cover of the cook-wagon, when it was
seen that the whole herd was slowly moving toward
the ford, the singing rustlers circling around
it.</p>
<p>Bud told off a dozen of his riders and instructed
each to pick a man and to ride as near in to him
as possible without being seen. Then, at the signal
of a coyote&#8217;s howl twice given, to close in and
get the drop on the rustlers, after which the remainder
of the body would come along and take
the direction of things.</p>
<p>Sims was put in charge of this maneuver, and
was at liberty to give the signal whenever he
thought circumstances justified it. It was a
strange procession that marched toward the ford
of the Big Horn&mdash;first fifteen hundred head of
calves and young steers, guarded by unsuspecting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
rustlers; then the knot of sheepmen and the dozen
riders closing in on their quarry, and, last of all
three miles back, eight thousand sheep clattering
through the dust.</p>
<p>For what seemed almost half an hour there
was silence. Then suddenly came the far-off,
long-drawn howl of a coyote, immediately followed
by another. Bud set spurs into his horse,
revolver in hand, the remaining eight men at his
heels, and made directly for the cook-wagon,
where he knew at least one or two of the outfit
might be sleeping.</p>
<p>The drumming of the horse&#8217;s hoofs could now
be plainly heard from all sides, and a moment
later there was a stab of light in the dark and
the first shot rang out.</p>
<p>After that there were many shots, for the rustlers,
keyed up to great alertness by the hazardness
of their calling, had opened fire without
waiting for question or answer.</p>
<p>Bud, as he dashed up to the cook-wagon, saw
two men crawl out and stand for a minute looking.
Then, as their hands moved to their hip-pockets
like one, he opened fire. At almost the
same instant the flames leaped from their guns,
and Bud&#8217;s hat was knocked awry by a bullet that
went clean through it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></p>
<p>Meantime the man who had been riding beside
him gave a grunt and fell from his saddle. One
of the rustlers doubled up where he stood.</p>
<p>Larkin, to avoid crashing full into the cook-wagon,
swerved his horse aside, as did the others.
The horse of the man who had been shot
stood still for a moment, and in that moment the
rustler who remained standing gave one leap and
had bestridden him.</p>
<p>Bud saw the maneuver just in time to wheel
his horse on a spot as big as a dollar and take
after the man in the darkness, yelling back, &#8220;Get
the others!&#8221; as he rode.</p>
<p>It was now a matter between the pursuer and
the pursued. Pounding away into the darkness,
heedless of gopher-holes, sunken spots, and other
dangers, the two sped. Occasionally the man
ahead would turn in his saddle and blaze away
at his pursuer, and Bud wondered that none of
these hastily fired bullets came near their mark.
For his part he saved his fire. It was not his
idea to shoot the rustlers, but rather to capture
them alive, since the unwritten law of that lawless
land decreed that shooting was too merciful
a death for horse- or cattle-thieves.</p>

<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 309px;'>
A moment later there was a stab of light in the dark and the first shot rang out.<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></div>
<p>But Larkin found, to his dismay, that the horse
of the other was faster than his own, and when
they had galloped about a mile he had to strain
his eyes to see the other at all. He knew that
unless he did something at once the other would
get away from him.</p>
<p>He lifted his revolver and took careful aim at
the barely perceptible form of the horse. Then,
when the other fired again, Larkin returned the
shot, and almost immediately noticed that he was
creeping up. At fifty yards the fleeing man
blazed away again, and this time Bud heard the
whistle of the bullet. Without further delay he
took a pot-shot at the rustler&#8217;s gun arm and, by
one of those accidents that the law of chance permits
to happen perhaps once in a lifetime, got
him.</p>
<p>After that the rustler pulled up his failing animal
to a walk and faced him around.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hands up!&#8221; yelled Larkin, covering the
other.</p>
<p>The answer was a streak of yellow flame from
the fellow&#8217;s left hand that had been resting on
his hip. The bullet flew wide as though the man
had never shot left-handed before, and Bud, furious
at the deception, dashed to close quarters recklessly,
not daring to shoot again for fear of killing
his man.</p>
<p>This move broke the rustler&#8217;s courage, and his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
left hand shot skyward. His right arm being
broken, he could not raise it. Larkin rode alongside
of him and peered into his face.</p>
<p>It was Smithy Caldwell.</p>
<p>Quickly Bud searched him for other weapons.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;re yuh goin&#8217; to do with me, Larkin?&#8221;
whined the blackmailer. &#8220;Don&#8217;t take me back
there. I haven&#8217;t done nothin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up and don&#8217;t be yellow,&#8221; admonished
Bud. &#8220;If you&#8217;re not guilty of anything you can
prove it quick enough, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I saved your life once,&#8221; pleaded the other.
&#8220;Let me go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You saved it so you could get more money
out of me. Think I don&#8217;t know you, Caldwell?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me go and I&#8217;ll give you back all that
money and all the rest you&#8217;ve ever given me. For
God&#8217;s sake don&#8217;t let &#8217;em hang me!&#8221;</p>
<p>The cowardice of the man was pitiful, but Bud
was unmoved. For years his life had been
dogged by this man. Now, an openly avowed
rustler, he expected clemency from his victim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ride ahead there,&#8221; ordered Bud. Caldwell,
whimpering, took his position.</p>
<p>&#8220;Put your hands behind you.&#8221; The other
made as though to comply with this command,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
when suddenly with a swift motion he put something
in his mouth.</p>
<p>Instantly Bud had him by the throat, forcing
his mouth open. Caldwell, forced by this grip,
spat out something that Bud caught with his free
hand. It was a piece of paper. Larkin slipped
it into the pocket of his shirt and released his
clutch. Then he bound Smithy&#8217;s hands and
started back toward the scene of the raid.</p>
<p>When he arrived, with his prisoner riding ahead
on the limping horse, he found that all was over.
Two of the rustlers were dead, but the rest were
sitting silent on the ground by the side of the
cook-wagon. One sheepman had been killed, and
another&#8217;s broken shoulder was being roughly
dressed by Sims.</p>
<p>Others of the sheepmen were riding around
the herd, quieting it. That there had been no
stampede was due to the fact that the shooting
had come from all sides at once, and the creatures,
bewildered, had turned in upon themselves and
crowded together in sheer terror, trampling to
death a number in the center of the herd.</p>
<p>Less than half a mile ahead were the banks
of the Big Horn and the ford. A mile behind
the leaders of the sheep were steadily advancing.
There was only one thing to be done.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Drive the cows across the ford,&#8221; commanded
Bud. Then he told off a detail to guard the prisoners,
and the rest of the men got the cattle in
motion toward the crossing.</p>
<p>Bud did not join this work. Instead, he pulled
from his pocket the bit of paper that Smithy
Caldwell had attempted to swallow. By the light
of a match he read what it said:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>The range is clear. Drive north fast to-nite and travel day
and nite. Meet me to-morrow at Indian Coulee at ten. Burn
this. <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Stelton</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>For a minute Bud stared at the incriminating
paper, absolutely unable to digest the information
it carried. Then with a rush understanding
came to him, and he knew that Mike Stelton, the
trusted foreman of the Bar T ranch, was really the
leader of the rustlers, and was the most active
of all of them in robbing old Beef Bissell.</p>
<p>For a long time he sat motionless on his horse,
reviewing all the events that had passed, which
now explained the remarkable activity of the rustlers
and their ability to escape pursuit and capture.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know where Indian Coulee is, Stelton,&#8221;
he said to himself, &#8220;but I&#8217;ll be there at ten
if it&#8217;s within riding distance.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>THE IMMORTAL TEN</h3>
</div>

<p>Jimmie Welsh threw his hand into the discard
and grinned sheepishly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yuh got me this time,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Billy Speaker, who held a full house, kings up,
smiled pleasantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I allow yuh&#8217;ll have to put yore gun in the
next pot if you want to stick along,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;An&#8217; if yuh do I&#8217;ll win it off yuh and get away
from here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Jimmie regretfully, &#8220;if it was any
other time I might resk it, but not now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Red Tarken, who had been shuffling the single
greasy pack of cards, began to deal. In the game
beside these three were two more sheepmen and
another cattle-raiser.</p>
<p>The six sat in the shade of a huge bowlder
that had broken off and rolled down the side
of the red scoria butte. The game had been going
on for hours, and captors and captives alike
played with all the cowboys&#8217; fervent love of gambling.
Tarken, Speaker, and their companion
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
were free to move as they liked, but were on parole
not to try to overpower their guardians.</p>
<p>Others of the eleven owners sat about in the
shade of rocks, playing cards, or talking and doing
their best to pass away the time. It was a
strange gathering. Only one man remained sitting
by himself with bent head and his hands
bound behind him. This was Beef Bissell, the
cattle-king, who had steadfastly refused to give
his word to remain peaceable, and fumed his life
away hour after hour with vain threats and recriminations.</p>
<p>At either end of the small inclosure that backed
against the butte, two men with Winchesters in
their hands bestrode motionless horses.</p>
<p>This perpetual guard, kept night and day,
though invisible from all but one small point, was
the only sign that there was anything but the
kindliest relations among all the members of the
party.</p>
<p>When the cowmen had found that no personal
harm was to be done them, all but Bissell and
one other had resigned themselves to making the
best of a laughably humiliating situation. It was
Billy Speaker himself who had suggested the idea
of the paroles, and as Jimmie Welsh knew the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
word of a Westerner was as good as his bond,
the pact was soon consummated.</p>
<p>It was a remarkable formation in a desolate
spot that the sheepmen had taken for a prison.
It is a common fact that on many of these high
buttes and mesas the pitiless weather of ages
has chiseled figures, faces, and forms which, in
their monstrous grotesquery, suggest the discarded
clay modelings of a half-witted giant.</p>
<p>This place was a kind of indentation in the
side of a precipitous butte, above which the cliff
(if it may be so called) arched over part way
like a canopy. The floor was of rock and lower
than the plain, but over it were scattered huge
blocks of stone that had fallen from above.
Other stones had, in the course of time, made a
sort of breastwork about this level flooring so
that the retreat was both a refuge and a defense.</p>
<p>Better even than its construction was its situation.
This particular spot was a corner of real
&#8220;bad lands,&#8221; and lumpy ridges, hogbacks, and
barren buttes arose on all sides like waves in a
sea. So numerous were they that unless riders
passed directly by the sheepmen&#8217;s hiding place the
chances of discovery were almost nil. At one
spot only was it visible, and that was a place where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
the edges of two hogbacks failed to lap and hide
it.</p>
<p>The sheepmen were aware of this, and their
two guards were placed out of range of that single
opening. The distance to it was almost half
a mile.</p>
<p>The game of poker went on. Billy Speaker sat
with his back to this opening, and after a while,
in the natural progress of things, the sun crept
over the top of the rock and smote him. It was
a hot sun, although it was declining, and presently
Billy gave warning that he was about to take
off his coat.</p>
<p>When he did so without an alarming display
of hidden weapons, the fancy suspenders he wore
came in for considerable attention. Now cowmen
or cowboys almost never wore braces; either
their trousers were tight enough at the waist to
stay up, or they wore a leather strap to hold them.
Suspenders hampered an active man.</p>
<p>But Billy Speaker, who had originally come
from Connecticut fifteen years ago, wore these
braces and treasured them because his mother had
given much light from her aging eyes and many
stitches from her faltering needle to the embroidery
that traveled up and down both shoulder
straps. She had embroidered everything he could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
wear time and again, and at last had fallen back
on the braces as something new.</p>
<p>After free and highly critical comment regarding
this particular aid to propriety, the game was
permitted to go on. It happened to be Billy
Speaker&#8217;s lucky day, and he had nearly cleaned
the entire six of all their money and part of their
outfits. In the exhilaration of raking in his gains
he moved about really lively, forgetful of the brilliantly
polished nickel-plated buckles that decorated
his shoulder-blades and denoted the height
to which his nether garment had been hoisted.</p>
<p>Out in the bad lands a troop of horsemen
moved slowly forward, detached bodies scouring
the innumerable hogbacks for signs of their prey.
There were a few more than a hundred in this
body, and it represented the pick of ten ranches.
At the head of it rode a stolid, heavy-faced man,
who appeared as though he were in constant need
of a shave, and whose features just now were
drawn down into a scowl of thought and perplexity.</p>
<p>This man&#8217;s body remained quite motionless as
his horse plodded on with hanging head, but his
small black eyes darted from side to side ceaselessly.</p>
<p>It was in one of these quick glances that he experienced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
a blinding flash upon his retina. A second
later it occurred again, and then a third time.
Suspiciously the man drew his horse to a stand,
and those behind him did likewise.</p>
<p>Stelton thought for a moment that there must
have been an outbreak from the near-by Wind
River or Shoshone Reservation, and that the Indians
were heliographing to one another. Presently,
in an open space between the edges of two
buttes he caught the flash close to the ground.</p>
<p>It probably was a tin can left by a herder&mdash;they
often flashed that way&mdash;but he would prove
it before he went on. He took from their case
the pair of field-glasses that swung from his shoulder
and raised them to his eyes.</p>
<p>What he saw caused him to swear excitedly and
order the company to back out of sight.</p>
<p>At the same instant Jimmie Welsh, holding a
straight flush, looked up triumphantly at Billy
Speaker who had just raised him. He looked
over Billy&#8217;s shoulder and the smile froze on his
face. He continued to look, and the cards
dropped one by one out of his hand. Then his
face became stern and he jumped to his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;No more of this,&#8221; he ordered. &#8220;We&#8217;re discovered.
You fellows get back out of sight,&#8221; he
added to the cowmen. &#8220;Here, Harry, Bill,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
Chuck, search these fellers again an&#8217; see they ain&#8217;t
got nothin&#8217; in their shoes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What ails yuh, Jimmie? Are yuh locoed?&#8221;
asked a man who had not understood the sudden
change in Welsh.</p>
<p>&#8220;I plenty wish I was,&#8221; came the reply, &#8220;but
I ain&#8217;t. We&#8217;ve been discovered, an&#8217; we&#8217;ve got to
fight. I don&#8217;t know how many there was in the
other party, but I &#8217;low we ain&#8217;t in it noways.
Red an&#8217; Plug, you take yore horses round the
butte to where the others are tethered, an&#8217; help
Jimmie and Newt bring in them casks o&#8217; water.
They ought to be back from the spring by this
time. Tip, Lem, and Jack, help me put our
friends here in the most-sheltered places.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a moment the camp that had been sleepy
and placid was bustling with a silent, grim activity.
From secret places men produced Winchesters,
revolvers, and knives, if they carried them.
In half an hour all the food had been brought
in, and the casks of water laboriously filled at a
brackish pool five miles away.</p>
<p>&#8220;That flush excited yuh so you seen a mirage,
Jimmie,&#8221; bantered Speaker, whose ready wit and
genial manner had won their way into the sheepman&#8217;s
affection.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; was the curt response. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
Welsh had seen no mirage, and he was aware of
the fact, knowing that a council of war was delaying
the action of the other party.</p>
<p>His chief concern was the disposal of his prisoners.
Excepting for the first line of breastworks,
the only protection in the flat area of the camp
was derived from the masses of stone that had
fallen into it, and behind which one or two men
could hide. At last it was decided that the prisoners,
unarmed as they were, should lie down behind
the wall out of danger&#8217;s way, while the
sheepmen should take their chances behind the
rocks. Another reason for this was, that it would
never do to have the prisoners behind the men
who were doing the fighting, ready to attack from
the rear at first chance.</p>
<p>Each man had fifty rounds of ammunition, and
was a fairly good shot, not, of course, equaling the
cowboys in this respect. The prisoners had
hardly been placed when, from behind a neighboring
hogback, rode a man waving a white handkerchief.</p>
<p>Welsh stepped out of the camp and drove him
back before he could talk, realizing the fellow&#8217;s
clever idea of spying on the defenders&#8217; position.</p>
<p>The cowboy had little to say except to demand
the immediate surrender of the cattle-owners and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
the delivery up to court martial of half the sheepmen.
Jimmie laughed in the messenger&#8217;s face,
and told him to tell whoever was boss of that outfit
to come and take anything he wanted, and to
come well heeled.</p>
<p>Then he went back to the rocky camp and stood
his men up in a row.</p>
<p>&#8220;We got to keep our guests another week yet,
boys,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Mr. Larkin won&#8217;t be up the
range till that time, and our job is to keep them
cowboys occupied so as to hold the range open
for the sheep. Now anybody what don&#8217;t want
to take chances with lead can go from here now
and get hung by the punchers. If there&#8217;s many
of &#8217;em I allow we won&#8217;t see Montana ag&#8217;in till
we&#8217;re angels; if there ain&#8217;t, they won&#8217;t see the Bar
T. Now that&#8217;s the story. One other thing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our guests are out in front. If yuh see any
of &#8217;em actin&#8217; funny or tryin&#8217; to get away, put a
hole in &#8217;em an&#8217; end that right off. Hear that,
boys?&#8221; he yelled to the cowmen who were on the
ground behind the defense.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep,&#8221; they shouted, and continued to chaff
one another unmercifully in the greatest good-humor.</p>
<p>The old story states that the Spartans prepared
for the battle of Thermopylæ by oiling their bodies
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
and brushing their hair, much to the surprise
of the Persians, who were forever wailing to their
gods. This story has come down to us to illustrate
solid, supreme courage in the face of certain
death.</p>
<p>No less inspiring, though in a different way,
was the preparation of Jimmie Welsh and his nine
sheepmen. They cracked jokes on the situation,
reminded one another of certain private weaknesses
under fire, recalled famous range yarns,
and enumerated the several hundred things that
were going to happen to the enemy during the
next few hours.</p>
<p>In all this banter the cowmen joined with their
own well-flavored wit.</p>
<p>These facts have been given to show the natures
of these men who made the West; who
carved, unasked, an empire for the profit of us
who live now, and who, in a space of less than
forty years, practically passed from the face of
the earth. Trained by their environment, they
finally conquered it and left it to a more-civilized
if softer generation.</p>
<p>At four o&#8217;clock of that afternoon came the first
attack.</p>
<p>Stelton and his men were under a great disadvantage.
In front of the sheepmen&#8217;s defense was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
a little plain some three hundred yards across
which was bare of any protection. The canopy
of rock that overshadowed the camp prevented
attack from above or behind. There was nothing
for it but an onslaught in the face of a deadly
fire.</p>
<p>Suddenly from around the butte that faced the
camp poured the charge of the cowboys. Instantly
they scattered wide, adopting the circling Indian
mode of attack. On they raced to a distance of
a hundred, then fifty yards.</p>
<p>Then, as though by preconcerted word, the
Winchesters of both parties spoke, and the cowboys,
turning at a sharp angle, galloped off out
of range with one riderless horse, and two men,
clinging, desperately wounded, to their pommels.</p>
<p>Jack Norton, one of the sheepmen, who had
exposed himself for a better shot, dropped dead
where he stood.</p>
<p>Now there was no word spoken. The helpless
cowmen huddled against the wall while the
hail of bullets swept over them in both directions,
cursed softly to themselves, and smoked cigarettes.
The punchers, having learned the lay of the land,
drew off for consultation. Half of them were
dispatched around the butte that protected the
defenders and the plan of attack was changed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span></p>
<p>On signal, the parties from both sides charged
along the face of the butte toward each other,
this movement being calculated to bring them out
close to the enclosure without the danger of an
attack in front, and at the same time give them
the chance to fire upon the sheepmen from a destructive
angle at either side.</p>
<p>The maneuver resulted in concentrating the
fire within a zone of twenty-five yards, and it was
fire so murderous that, before the cowboys could
get out of range, ten were dead or wounded,
while two of the sheepmen were killed outright
and a third was disabled and rolled out into the
sun to writhe in agony until his pal ran from cover
and dragged him back.</p>
<p>The result was now a foregone conclusion, for
the cowboys had solved the difficult problem of
attack. Mushrooming out on either side at a distance
of three hundred yards, they formed again
in the shelter on either side and charged once
more.</p>
<p>The wounded man, hearing the drumming of
hoofs, seized his revolver, rolled out into the sun,
and sat up on the ground. And from this position
he emptied his gun at the yelling cowboys until
another shot put him out of his misery.</p>
<p>More cowboys fell, and now, in front of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
stone breastworks, a dozen bodies lay, some
twitching, and others still. The number of the
defenders was reduced to five capable of holding
and using a weapon, for such marksmen were
the punchers that, if they did not kill outright,
their bullets inflicted mortal wounds.</p>
<p>Jimmie Welsh was undisturbed and unhurt.
He and Newt were sheltered behind one rock,
while Tip and Lem defended another, and Chuck
Durstine held a third by the side of his dead
partner, Red. The fourth charge found them
lying on the ground, contrary to their former practice
of standing, and they escaped unhurt, although
their ability to shoot the mounted punchers above
the wall was not diminished. Again they wrought
terrible havoc.</p>
<p>&#8220;I sure wish I could&#8217;ve cleaned up on that
straight flush, Billy,&#8221; remarked Jimmie Welsh
to Speaker.</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I, Jimmie,&#8221; returned the other; &#8220;yore
bad luck was just breakin&#8217;. But, look here. Suppose
you fellers quit this business now. I don&#8217;t
relish yore all bein&#8217; slaughtered this-a-way,
and it&#8217;s shore a comin&#8217; to yuh if yuh don&#8217;t
quit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yuh talk like a Sunday-school class had stampeded
on yuh, Billy. I&#8217;m surprised!&#8221; gibed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
Welsh. &#8220;Mebbe yuh don&#8217;t like yore flowery bed
of ease out there, what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All horsin&#8217; aside, I mean it,&#8221; insisted
Speaker. &#8220;Yuh better quit now before they come
ag&#8217;in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, an&#8217; get strung up to the nearest tree
fer my pains, eh? Oh, no; I like this better; but,
of course, if any o&#8217; the boys&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Naw! What the deuce are yuh talkin&#8217;
about?&#8221; demanded an aggrieved voice, instantly
joined by the other three.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re wrong, Jimmie; of course, I don&#8217;t
mean that. If yuh&#8217;ll quit I&#8217;ll see that yuh don&#8217;t
get strung up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re shore some friendly, Billy,&#8221; said Jimmie,
shaking his head; &#8220;but I couldn&#8217;t never look
my boss in the face if I even thought o&#8217; quittin&#8217;.
That ain&#8217;t what he pays me fer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give yuh a job as foreman on the Circle
Arrow. I see one of you hellions got my foreman;
he&#8217;s layin&#8217; out there kickin&#8217; still. What
d&#8217;ye say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m plumb regretful, Billy,&#8221; returned Welsh,
without hesitation; &#8220;but I can&#8217;t do it. Mebbe
one o&#8217; the boys&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Naw!&#8221; said the boys in unified contempt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, yuh pig-headed sons o&#8217; misery, go on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
an&#8217; die, then!&#8221; cried Speaker, quite out of
patience.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jest a minute an&#8217; we&#8217;ll oblige yuh, Billy,&#8221; rejoined
Welsh, as the dreaded drumming of hoofs
foretold the next charge.</p>
<p>There was a tense moment of waiting, and then
the fusillade began again, pitifully weak from the
sheepmen. When the horsemen had whirled out
of sight Lem and Newt lay groaning on the
ground, while Tip O&#8217;Niell lay strangling in a torrent
of blood that rushed from what had once
been his face.</p>
<p>Welsh took one look at the tortured man, and
with a crack over the head from the butt of his
pistol, rendered him unconscious and stilled his
blood-curdling agonies. Then he walked over to
the cowmen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anybody got the makin&#8217;s?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;One
o&#8217; them punchers spilt mine out o&#8217; my pocket last
time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nonchalantly he showed the clean rent on the
left side of his flannel shirt, just over his heart,
where his pocket had been.</p>
<p>Somebody handed up the paper and tobacco,
and he rolled a cigarette, tossing the materials
back to Chuck Durstine, who sauntered up, examining
his gun curiously.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></p>
<p>Durstine, from his appearance, had no right to
be alive. His cheek bled where a bullet had grazed
him, his left arm was scratched, and there were
three holes in his clothes. His revolver was so
hot he could hardly hold it.</p>
<p>When they had finished their smoke they started
back to their shelter, the middle rock of the enclosure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, good-by, boys,&#8221; said Jimmie. &#8220;I allow
it&#8217;s pretty near my turn an&#8217; Chuck&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by!&#8221; came the chorus from the owners,
all of whom had pleaded steadily with the two
to give up the unequal struggle. These men
were hard and brave men, and they appreciated
genuine grit as nothing else in the world, for it
was a great factor in their own make-up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell yuh this, Jimmie,&#8221; called out Beef
Bissell, whose conceptions had been undergoing
a radical change for the last two hours, &#8220;if you
an&#8217; Chuck are sheepmen, I take off my hat to
yuh, that&#8217;s all! I never seen better fighters anywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yuh ought to see us when we ain&#8217;t dry-nursin&#8217;
a dozen cattle-owners,&#8221; retorted Welsh, amid a
great guffaw of laughter.</p>
<p>Suddenly again sounded the roar of the galloping
horses.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, so-long, boys!&#8221; yelled Chuck, his voice
barely audible.</p>
<p>&#8220;So-long.&#8221;</p>
<p>The chorused response was cut short by the
spitting of weapons. Chuck faced to the left,
Welsh to the right. Both pumped two guns as
fast as they could. Presently Chuck dropped one
and leaned against the rock, his face distorted, but
the other gun going. Jimmie felt a stab of fire,
and found his weight all resting on one foot.
Dropping their pistols, they drew others from
holsters and fought on.</p>
<p>A bullet furrowed Chuck&#8217;s scalp, and the blood
blinded him so that he could not shoot. He
stepped out from behind the rock, &#8220;fanning&#8221; one
gun and clearing his eyes with the other hand.
Three bullets hit him at once, and he dropped
dead, firing three shots before he reached the
ground.</p>
<p>He had scarcely fallen when Welsh&#8217;s other leg
and both arms were broken, and he tumbled in a
heap just as the last of the charging cowboys swept
past. When they had gone there was a moment&#8217;s
silence. Then:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, anybody!&#8221; called Speaker.</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; came a muffled voice. &#8220;Come
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
an&#8217; git me. I cain&#8217;t fight no more.&#8221; And with
a great shout the owner of the Circle Arrow outfit
ran to where Jimmie Welsh, the indomitable,
lay helpless, disabled by six bullets, but still full
of fight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stick me up on that wall, Billy,&#8221; he said faintly,
&#8220;an&#8217; put a gun in each hand. I can&#8217;t shoot &#8217;em,
but them punchers&#8217;ll think I can and finish me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You go to Hell!&#8221; remarked Speaker joyfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t call yore ranch names,&#8221; admonished
Jimmie with a grin, and fainted.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>AN INDIAN COULEE</h3>
</div>

<p>By four o&#8217;clock in the morning the fifteen hundred
head of cattle had crossed the ford of
the Big Horn and were bedded down on the other
side. When this hazardous business had been
completed, Bud Larkin ordered the sheep brought
up and kept on the eastern bank among the cool
grass of the bottoms.</p>
<p>The captive rustlers, under guard, were being
held until daylight, when, it had been decided, they
would be taken to the almost deserted Bar T ranch,
and kept there until further action could be determined
on in regard to them.</p>
<p>When dawn finally came Bud looked at the
stolid faces of the men, and recognized most of
them as having belonged to the party that had
so nearly ended his earthly career. He called
them by their names, and some of them grinned
a recognition.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hardly expected to meet yuh again,&#8221; said one
amiably. &#8220;Thought it might be t&#8217;other side of
Jordan, but not this side of the Big Horn.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s one advantage of raising sheep,&#8221; retorted
Bud. &#8220;Mine are so well trained they stampede
in time to save my life. You fellows ought
to have joined me in the business then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wisht we had,&#8221; remarked another gloomily.
&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t so hard on the neck in the end.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bud wondered at the hardihood of a man who,
facing sure death, could still joke grimly about it.</p>
<p>Directly after breakfast the rustlers were
mounted on their horses, with their arms tied behind
them, and, under a guard of six men, started
on their journey to the Bar T. In charge of the
outfit was a gray-haired sheep-owner from Montana,
and to his care Bud entrusted a long letter
to Juliet that he had added to day by day with
a pencil as opportunity offered.</p>
<p>It was such a letter as a lonely girl in love likes
to get, and Bud&#8217;s only thought in sending it was
to prove that she was ever in his mind, and that
he was still safe and well.</p>
<p>Weary and sleepless, Bud then prepared for
the ordeal with Stelton. From Sims, who seemed
to know the country thoroughly, he learned that
Indian Coulee was almost thirty miles south-east,
and could be distinguished by the rough weather-sculpture
of an Indian head on the butte that
formed one side of the ravine.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span></p>
<p>Lest there be a misunderstanding, it should be
said here that this was the second day after the
battle of Welsh&#8217;s Butte, as it came to be known.
The first day the punchers had been busy burying
the dead and attending to the numerous things to
which such an occasion gives rise. It was on the
morning of this day that Stelton, giving as an
excuse his urgent desire to return to the Bar T,
had ridden away, commanding his cowboys to remain
and do their portion of the work.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon he had met Smithy Caldwell
in a secret place, and given him a note to the
leader of the band of rustlers. This Caldwell,
with his usual tricky foresight, did not deliver,
giving the message by word of mouth, and keeping
the piece of paper as evidence in case Stelton
should turn against him.</p>
<p>Stelton, anxious to hear how the commencement
of the drive fared before returning to the
Bar T ranch, camped in the hills that night, and
moved on to Indian Coulee the next morning to
await the messenger.</p>
<p>Just previous to starting on the long ride, Larkin
called Sims to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, I&#8217;ll tell you why I want these cows,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to rush the sheep up the range.
As soon as I&#8217;m gone start &#8217;em, but surround the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
sheep with a line of cows, and keep a good bunch
ahead. From a distance it will look like a cattle-drive,
and may serve to throw the punchers off the
track if they&#8217;re anywhere in sight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By Michaeljohn! That&#8217;s a good idea!&#8221; exclaimed
Sims; &#8220;but I don&#8217;t allow either of them
will feed much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let &#8217;em starve, then; but keep &#8217;em moving,&#8221;
said Bud. &#8220;We win or bust on this effort. Fact
is, we&#8217;ve got to keep those cows anyhow, to return
them to their owners if possible, and you might
as well make some good use of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mike Stelton, meanwhile, who had often used
the place as a rendezvous before, went into the
usual shady spot, dropped the reins over his horse&#8217;s
head, and lay down.</p>
<p>Stelton&#8217;s heart was at peace, for the sheepmen
he considered defeated at every angle. Jimmie
Welsh, half dead and delirious, was on his way
to the Circle Arrow ranch under Billy Speaker&#8217;s
care. Consequently, it was impossible that Bud
Larkin should know anything of the battle at
Welsh&#8217;s Butte.</p>
<p>Larkin would go on about his plans, dreaming
the cowmen still in captivity, and the pursuing
punchers on a false trail, Stelton calculated. Then
he chuckled at the surprise in store for the ambitious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
sheepmen, for the remaining cowboys under
Beef Bissell had already begun to talk of a war
of extermination and revenge.</p>
<p>When he had disposed of Larkin to his satisfaction,
the foreman recollected with delight that
the rustlers must have the fifteen hundred cows well
up the range by this morning. The chance of
their being intercepted by the cowboys was small,
and the probabilities were that they would be at
the northern shipping-point and well out of the
way before the punchers had finished with the
miserable sheep.</p>
<p>Two things Mike Stelton had not counted on.
One was the prompt and daring action of Larkin
in risking his all on one forced march up the range;
the other was the treachery of Smithy Caldwell
in not burning the note according to instructions.</p>
<p>From the first Stelton had &#8220;doped&#8221; Caldwell
out all wrong. He took him for a really evil character
supplied with a fund of sly cunning and clever
brains that would benefit the rustlers immensely,
and for that reason had warmly supported his
application for membership. Somehow he did not
see the cowardly streak and dangerous selfishness
that were the man&#8217;s two distinguishing traits.</p>
<p>Now, as Stelton lay in the shade with his hat
over his face, steeped in roseate dreams, the weariness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
of a week of long marches and an afternoon&#8217;s
hard fighting oppressed him. He had been riding
nights of late, and just to lie down was to feel
drowsy. He would like to get a nap before the
sun got directly above and left no shade whatever,
but he did not permit himself this luxury, although,
like all men with uneasy consciences, he was a very
light sleeper.</p>
<p>He figured that he could hear the trotting of a
horse in plenty of time to prepare for any possible
danger, and remained flat on his back in the
warm sun, half-asleep, but yet keenly alert.</p>
<p>Bud Larkin, sighting the coulee and Stelton&#8217;s
horse at a considerable distance, dismounted and
promptly got out of range. Then he continued
stealthily to approach, wondering why Stelton did
not put in an appearance somewhere and start
hostilities.</p>
<p>A quarter of a mile from the spot where Stelton&#8217;s
horse stood dejectedly Larkin left his own
animal and proceeded on foot. Nearer and nearer
he approached, and still there was no sign of
Stelton.</p>
<p>Bud unslung his glasses, and scanning the rocks
near the horse carefully, at last made out the small
outline of a booted foot along the ground. Then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
he drew his revolver and crept forward, choosing
every step with care.</p>
<p>At a distance of thirty yards his foot unconsciously
crunched a bit of rotten stone. There
was a scrambling behind the rock, and a moment
later Stelton&#8217;s head appeared. Bud had him covered
with two revolvers, and on sight of the dark
face ran forward to finish the job.</p>
<p>But the foreman was no mollycoddle, and with
one lightning-like motion unlimbered his .45 and
began to shoot. Like most Western gun-handlers,
his revolver commenced to spit as soon as its
mouth was out of the holster, and the bullets
spurted up the sand twice in front of Bud before
the muzzle had reached a dangerous angle, so
swiftly was it fired.</p>
<p>But the sheepman was not idle, and had both
guns working so accurately that at last Stelton
drew in his head, but left his hand around the
corner of the rock, still pulling the trigger. He
would never have done this with any other man,
but he still considered Larkin a &#8220;dude&#8221; and a
sheepman, and knew that neither was much of a
shot.</p>
<p>With a ball through his right foot, Bud hopped
out of the path of the stream of lead and discharged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
each revolver once at the same spot. The
result was a broken hand and a wrecked gun for
Stelton, who, unfortunately, did not know that
Larkin, on occasions, had split the edges of playing
cards with dueling pistols.</p>
<p>Before the Bar T foreman could reach his Winchester,
Bud was around the rock, and had him
covered. Stelton gave one look at the hard, determined
eyes of the sheepman and thought better
of the impulse to bolt for the rifle on a chance.
He slowly hoisted his hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, darn it, what do yuh want?&#8221; he snarled.</p>
<p>&#8220;First I want you to back up against that rock
and keep your hands in the air until I tell you to
take &#8217;em down,&#8221; said Bud, in a tone that meant
business.</p>
<p>Stelton obeyed the command sullenly. Then
Larkin, keeping him covered, picked up the Winchester
and found another .45 in an extra holster
thrown over the pommel of the saddle. Next he
took down Stelton&#8217;s rope.</p>
<p>Larkin was satisfied with his investigations.
&#8220;Turn around and face the rock, and hold your
hands out behind you!&#8221; he ordered.</p>
<p>With the wicked glitter of an animal at bay in
his eye, Stelton did as he was told, and in a moment
Larkin had him bound and helpless, and on
the end of a tether. Still covering his man, he
mounted Stelton&#8217;s horse and told him to march
ahead.</p>

</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span></div>
<p>In this manner they traveled the quarter-mile
to Bud&#8217;s animal. There they exchanged beasts,
and started on the long ride back to the sheep
camp.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;re yuh doin&#8217; this for?&#8221; stormed Stelton,
at a loss to explain the sudden appearance of
Larkin in Caldwell&#8217;s place, but beginning to have
a terrible fear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t.&#8221; His tone was convincing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll tell you. All the rustlers are taken,
and I have absolute proof that you are their
leader,&#8221; replied Bud coolly. &#8220;I allow old Bissell
will be glad to see you when you&#8217;re brought in,
eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>Stelton laughed contemptuously.</p>
<p>&#8220;What proof?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;A note to Smithy Caldwell that he forgot to
burn. He tried to swallow it when I captured
him, but I saw him first.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stelton stood the blow well and made no answer,
but Larkin, watching him, saw his head drop
a trifle as though he were crushed by some heavy
weight.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;re yuh goin&#8217; to do with me now?&#8221; he
asked at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ship you under guard to the Bar T ranch,
where the rest have gone. Then the cattlemen
can settle your case when they come back from
their vacation.&#8221;</p>
<p>For an instant it was on Stelton&#8217;s tongue to
blurt out what had happened two days previous,
but an instinctive knowledge that Larkin would
profit by the information restrained him, and he
continued riding on in silence, a prey to dismal
thoughts better imagined than described.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>SOMEBODY NEW TURNS UP</h3>
</div>

<p>Utterly exhausted with his day&#8217;s riding
and the stress of his other labors, Bud
Larkin, driving his captive, arrived at the sheep
camp shortly before sundown. Faint with hunger&mdash;for
he had not eaten since morning&mdash;he turned
Stelton over to the eager sheepmen who rode out
to meet him.</p>
<p>Things had gone well that day with the drive,
for the animals, under pressure, had made fifteen
miles. The cattle, at first hard to manage, had
finally been induced to lead and flank the march,
but neither they nor the sheep had grazed much.</p>
<p>When Larkin arrived they had just reached a
stream and had been separated from the sheep
that both might drink untainted water. Sims had
set his night watchers, and these were beginning
to circle the herd. The sheep were bedding down
on a near-by rise of ground.</p>
<p>Larkin, having eaten, cooled and bathed himself
in the stream and returned to the camp for
rest. Shortly thereafter a single horseman, laden
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
with a bulky apparatus, was seen approaching from
a distance. Immediately men mounted and rode
out to meet him, and returned with him to camp
when he had proved himself harmless and
expressed a desire to remain all night in the
camp.</p>
<p>It was Ed Skidmore, the photographer, who
had just completed a profitable day at Red Tarken&#8217;s
ranch, the M Square.</p>
<p>Larkin, who was lying on the ground, heard the
excitement as the newcomer rode into camp, and
got up to inspect him. Skidmore had dismounted,
and had his back turned when Bud approached,
but suddenly turned so that the two came face to
face.</p>
<p>As their eyes met, both started back as though
some terrible thing had come between them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bud! My Heavens!&#8221; cried Skidmore,
turning pale under his tan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lester!&#8221; was all that Larkin said as he stared
with starting eyes and sagging jaw at the man
before him. Then, as one in a dream, he put out
his hand, and the other, with a cry of joy, seized
and wrung it violently.</p>
<p>For a moment the two stood thus looking
amazedly at each other, while the sheepmen, suddenly
stricken into silence, gazed curiously at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
episode. Then, one by one, they turned and
walked away, leaving the two together.</p>
<p>It was Bud who found his voice first.</p>
<p>&#8220;What under heaven are you doing out here,
Lester?&#8221; he asked at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;Earning a living making pictures,&#8221; returned
the other with a short laugh. &#8220;It must be quite
a shock to you to see me actually working.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t deny it,&#8221; said Bud as he smiled a bit.
&#8220;But when did you come out?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Six months after you did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why on earth didn&#8217;t you let me know?
I would have given you a job on the ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just why I didn&#8217;t let you know. I
didn&#8217;t want a job on the ranch. I wanted to do
something for myself. I concluded I had been
dependent on other people about long enough.
I&#8217;m not mushy, or converted, or anything like that,
Bud, but I figured that when the governor died
and left me without a cent I had deserved everything
I got and was a disgrace to the family and
myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Same with me, Lester,&#8221; acknowledged Bud.
&#8220;If you had only told me how you felt about
things we could have struck out here together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you with all the money? I guess not,&#8221;
and Lester spoke bitterly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d have divided with you in a minute, if you
had talked to me the way you&#8217;re doing now. We
always used to divide things when we were kids,
you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s square of you, Bud, but I really don&#8217;t
want the money now. I&#8217;m making a good go of
my pictures; I don&#8217;t owe anybody, and I haven&#8217;t
an enemy that I know of. What have you done
with your money?&#8221;</p>
<p>Larkin turned around and motioned toward the
thousands of sheep dotted over the hills.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s all my available cash. Of course
there was some in securities I couldn&#8217;t realize
on by the terms of father&#8217;s will, and if I go to
the wall I can always get enough to live on out
of that. But my idea is to get a living out of
<i>this</i>, and just now I am in the very devil of a
fix.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bud narrated briefly the stormy events that had
led up to this final stroke by which he hoped to
defeat the cowmen and save his own fortune; and
as he did so he observed his brother closely.</p>
<p>Lester Larkin was three years younger than
Bud, was smaller, and had grown up with a weak
and vacillating character. The youngest child in
the wealthy Larkin family, he had been spoiled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
and indulged until when a youth in his teens he
had become the despair of them all.</p>
<p>Even now, despite the tanned look of health he
had acquired, it could still be seen that he was by
no means the strong, virile young man that Bud
had become. His face was rather delicate than
rugged in outline; his brown hair was inclined to
curl, and his blue eyes were large and beautiful.</p>
<p>The sensitive mouth was still wilful, though
character was beginning to show there. He was,
in fact, a grand mistake in upbringing. With all
the instincts of a lover of beauty he had been raised
by a couple of dull parents to a rule-of-thumb existence
that started in a business office late one
morning and ended in a café early the next.</p>
<p>It was the kind of life to which the poor laborer
looks up with consuming envy, and which makes
him what he thinks is a socialist. Given a couple
of sharp pencils and some blocks of paper, along
with sympathy and encouragement, Lester Larkin
might have become a writer or an artist of no mean
ability.</p>
<p>But the elder Larkin, believing that what had
made one generation would make another, had
started young Lester on a high stool in his office
with a larger percentage of dire results than he
had ever imagined could accrue to the employment
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
of one individual. With the high stool went a
low wage and a lot of wholesome admonitions&mdash;and
this, after a boyhood and early youth spent
in the very lap of luxury.</p>
<p>Thus, when the father died, the boy, at nineteen,
knew more ways to spend a dollar than his father
had at thirty-nine, and less ways to earn it than
his father at nine. So much for Lester.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if I can help you in any way, Bud, let
me know,&#8221; he said when his brother had finished
his story of the range war that was now reaching
its climax. &#8220;I rather imagine I would like a jolly
good fight for a change.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to get hurt, kid,&#8221; replied
Bud, smiling at the other&#8217;s enthusiasm, &#8220;but I have
an idea that I can use you somehow. Just stick
around for a day or two and I&#8217;ll show you how to
&#8217;walk&#8217; sheep so your eyes&#8217;ll pop out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s purely a matter of business with me,&#8221; rejoined
Lester. &#8220;Pictures of seventy men at five
dollars apiece, selling only one to each, will be
three hundred and fifty dollars. I think I&#8217;ll
stick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose I get &#8217;em all in one group so you
can&#8217;t take individuals, then what will you do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make more money still,&#8221; retorted the other
promptly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll sell seventy copies of the same
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
picture at five apiece and only have to do one developing.
What are you tryin&#8217; to do, kid me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bud laughed and gave up the attempt to confuse
the boy.</p>
<p>During the next two days Bud saw more sheep-walking
than he had seen since going into the
business, and Lester amused himself profitably by
taking pictures of the embarrassed plainsmen, many
of whom would not believe it possible that an exact
image of them could be reproduced in the twinkling
of an eye, but who were willing to pay the price
if the feat were accomplished.</p>
<p>When he had filled all his private orders, the
picturesqueness of the life and outfit with which
he traveled so appealed to Lester that he made
nearly a hundred plates depicting the daily events
of the drive and the camp. And these hundred
plates, three-quarters of which were excellent,
form by far the best collection of actual Western
scenes of that time and are still preserved in the
old Larkin ranch house in Montana.</p>
<p>At the end of the two days the Gray Bull River
was still twenty miles away and would require
an equal amount of time to be reached and crossed.
During this period Bud Larkin knew nothing whatever
of the fate of Jimmie Welsh and his companions,
believing that they still held the repentant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
cowmen captive, and that the punchers in pursuit
were still searching the bad lands for them&mdash;an
almost endless task.</p>
<p>He was in a state of high good humor that his
plans had carried out so well, and looked forward
with almost feverish impatience to the glorious
hour when the last of his bawling merinos should
stand dripping, but safe, on the other side of the
Gray Bull. The nearer approach to the stream
brought a greater nervous tension and scouts at a
five-mile radius rode back and forth all day searching
for any signs of spying cowpunchers.</p>
<p>The thought that he might effect the passage
without hindrance or loss was stretching the improbable
in Bud&#8217;s mind, and he devoted much time
every day to an inspection of his supplies and
accouterments.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>JULIE INVESTIGATES</h3>
</div>

<p>The occasion when nine men with their hands
tied behind them arrived at the Bar T
ranch, accompanied by six others with Winchesters
across their saddle bows, was an extremely happy
one for Juliet Bissell. This happiness was not
associated, except superficially, with the capture of
the rustlers, but had to do especially with the
receipt of a certain smeared and blackened journal
from a certain tall and generously proportioned
young man.</p>
<p>The captives arrived at noon, but it was nearly
supper-time before she had finished reading,
around, amid, among and between the lines, despite
the fact that the lines themselves left very little
doubt as to the writer&#8217;s meaning.</p>
<p>This was not the same beautiful girl Bud Larkin
had left behind him that early morning of his escape.
Since that time she had changed. The eyes
that had formerly been but the beautiful abode of
allurement and half-spoken promises, had taken
on a sweet and patient seriousness. The corners
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
of her mouth still turned up as though she were
about to smile, but there was a firmer set to them
that spoke of suppressed impulses.</p>
<p>She moved with a greater dignity, and for the
first time became aware of the real worth of her
mother, who until now she had somehow taken
for granted. Martha&#8217;s consternation and grief at
her husband&#8217;s sudden and prolonged disappearance,
only broken by the visit of Skidmore and his
camera, had been really pitiful, and the girl&#8217;s eyes
were opened to the real value and beauty of an
undying love.</p>
<p>Her own misery, after the receipt of the letter
brought by Skidmore, she had faced alone, and
in her, as in all good and true natures, it had
worked a change. It had softened her to the
grief of another, and showed her, for the first
time, that happiness is only really great when in
sharp contrast with pain.</p>
<p>So this long and simple love-letter from Bud,
while satisfying the cravings of the lover, stirred
up again the misgivings of the doubter. And her
cogitations resulted in the admission that Bud must
be either one of two things. Either he was absolutely
innocent of the imputations contained in
the letter that Skidmore brought, or he was one
of the most consummate villains at large.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span></p>
<p>There were grounds for both suppositions, and
the girl, after hours of vain struggle, found herself
still in the middle ground, but more nervous
and anxious than she had ever been.</p>
<p>The arrival of Mike Stelton under guard two
days after that of the other rustlers created a sensation.
For the girl it was the blow that shattered
another illusion, for although she had never
cared for the foreman, her belief in his unswerving
faithfulness to the Bissell house was absolute.
Now to see him the admitted leader of the gang
that had steadily impoverished her father was almost
unbelievable.</p>
<p>The man who brought Stelton in also brought
a hurried scrawl to Juliet from Bud, which read:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Darling</span>:</p>
<p>We are more than half-way up the range. Have recovered
1,500 head of rebranded stock, much of which is Bar T. Stelton
is the head of the rustlers and I have the proof. Sorry
to foist these criminals on the Bar T, but it was the nearest
ranch, and besides, I want them there when your father comes
home. Also I want to be able to tell you that I love you,
and will love you always. With luck, two days ought to see
the end of all these troubles.</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Your Bud</span>.</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>Probably the most miserable man in the whole
cow country at this time was Smithy Caldwell.
Aside from the fate he feared, his position among
the captured rustlers was one of utter torture.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
The men had discovered that it was through his
selfish scheming that Stelton had been betrayed,
and they treated him with the cruelty and scorn of
rough, savage men.</p>
<p>So, when Stelton appeared, Caldwell fairly
cringed. With the strange, unreasoning terror of
a coward he feared bodily harm at the hands of
the foreman, forgetting that, in all probability,
his life was forfeit sooner or later.</p>
<p>His fear was all but realized, for no sooner
were Stelton&#8217;s hands unbound as he caught sight
of Caldwell than he made a leap for him and
would have strangled him then and there had not
others pulled the two apart.</p>
<p>&#8220;There, you whelp!&#8221; bellowed Stelton.
&#8220;That&#8217;s a sample of what you&#8217;ll get later on.
All I ask is to see you kickin&#8217; at the end of a rope,
you yellow-bellied traitor!&#8221; And Smithy, clutching
at his throat, staggered, whimpering, away.</p>
<p>The day after Stelton&#8217;s arrival Juliet conceived
the idea of questioning the foreman about the
letter that she knew Smithy Caldwell had written
her. At her request he was brought into the
living-room of the ranch house with his hands
tied to permit of the guard leaving them together.</p>
<p>Now that all Bud&#8217;s prophecies in regard to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
man had been fulfilled, she feared him, and one
glance at his dark, contorted face as he was led in
increased this fear.</p>
<p>For his part the very sight of this sweet, quiet
girl for whom he had waited so long, and through
whose lover he was now doomed, brought a very
eruption of rage. His lips parted and bared his
teeth, his eyes were bloodshot, and his swarthy
face worked with fury.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mike, I&#8217;m sorry to see you here like this,&#8221;
said Juliet gently.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot you are!&#8221; he sneered brutally.
&#8220;You&#8217;re tickled to death. Hope to see me swing,
too, I suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk like that,&#8221; she protested, horrified
at the change in the man. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to try to
see what I can do for you, though Heaven knows
you don&#8217;t deserve much.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fury choked him and prevented a reply. At
last he managed to articulate.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do yuh want of me?&#8221; he growled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to tell me about a letter that I
received a few days ago. It was brought here
by a man by the name of Skidmore, who takes
pictures.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the identification of the letter, Stelton&#8217;s eyes
glittered and his mouth grinned cruelly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What do yuh want to know about it?&#8221; he
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;First I want to know why you wrote it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t write it,&#8221; he snarled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, why you had Caldwell write it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know I had Caldwell write it?&#8221;</p>
<p>His tone was nasty and she could see that he
was enjoying the misery he caused her.</p>
<p>But though Juliet was humbled, she was none
the less a daughter of her father, and at Stelton&#8217;s
tone and manner her imperious anger flashed up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, Stelton,&#8221; she said in a cold, even
tone, &#8220;please remember who I am and treat me
with respect. If you speak to me again as you
have this afternoon I will call those men in and
have you quirted up against a tree. If you don&#8217;t
believe me, try it.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Stelton was beyond speech. All the blood
in him seemed to rush to his head and distend the
veins there. He struggled with his bonds so furiously
that the girl rose to her feet in alarm. Then
she walked to the library table, opened the drawer
and took out a long, wooden-handled .45.</p>
<p>With this in her possession she resumed her
seat. Presently the foreman, unable to free his
hands, ceased his struggles through sheer exhaustion.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I know you made Caldwell write that letter,&#8221;
she said, balancing the gun, &#8220;and I want to know
why you did it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Stelton, finding physical intimidation impossible,
resorted to mental craft.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t want you to love that sheepman,&#8221; he
replied sullenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because all those things about him are true,
and I thought I&#8217;d let yuh know before yuh broke
yore heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>She searched his face keenly and had to confess
to herself that he spoke with absolute sincerity.
Her face slowly paled, and for a moment the
room seemed to whirl about her. The world appeared
peopled with horrible gargoyles that resembled
Stelton and that leered and gibbered at
her everywhere.</p>
<p>The foreman saw her wince and grow pallid,
and his fury was cooled with the ice of fiendish
satisfaction. He could hurt her now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you say so doesn&#8217;t prove it to me,&#8221;
she managed to say at last, though she scarcely
recognized the voice that came from her tremulous
lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can give you proof enough if you want it,&#8221;
he snapped, suddenly taken with an idea.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You can?&#8221; The words were pitiful, and her
voice broke with the stress of her misery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get Smithy Caldwell in here. He knew that
lover of yore&#8217;s when he wasn&#8217;t quite such a sheepman.
He&#8217;ll tell yuh things that&#8217;ll make yore hair
stand on end.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his delight at his plan Stelton could not keep
the exultant cruelty out of his voice.</p>
<p>Juliet pounded on the floor with the butt of her
weapon (this was the signal agreed upon for the
removal of Stelton), and a sheepman almost immediately
thrust his head in at the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bring Smithy Caldwell in, please,&#8221; she requested,
&#8220;and tie his hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the miserable fellow was pushed through
the doorway and saw Stelton standing inside he
shrank back against the wall and stood looking
from one to the other with the quick, white eyes
of a trapped animal. The thought came to him
that perhaps these two were already deciding his
fate, and his weak chin quivered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down, Caldwell,&#8221; said Juliet, coolly motioning
him to one of the rough chairs. He slunk
into it obediently.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I want to ask you about that letter you sent
me in which you said several things about Mr.
Larkin,&#8221; she went on not unkindly, her heart going
out to the wretch, so abject was his misery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mike here says that everything in that letter
is true, and that you can prove it,&#8221; she continued.
&#8220;Is that so?&#8221;</p>
<p>Involuntarily Caldwell looked toward Stelton
for orders, as he had always done, and in those
beetling brows and threatening eyes saw a menace
of personal injury that indicated his course at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, don&#8217;t look at Mike; look at me,&#8221; cried
Juliet, and Caldwell obediently switched his gaze
back. &#8220;Are those things true?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; said Caldwell without hesitation.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean to tell me that he was married
before?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In Chicago to a woman by the name of Mary.
She was a cousin of mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, God!&#8221; The low cry burst from Juliet&#8217;s
pale lips before she could recover herself, and
Stelton lay back in his chair, feeding his unspeakable
nature upon the girl&#8217;s torture.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I tell you about it?&#8221; Caldwell, seeing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
his former chief was pleased, now took the
initiative.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, no!&#8221; she cried frantically. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
want to hear. I never want to hear!&#8221;</p>
<p>For a few moments there was silence in the low,
bare room while Juliet recovered herself. Then
she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;And about that other thing in the letter.
Why are the officers after Bud?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For forgery, ma&#8217;am. That is, I mean, they
would be after him if they knew everything.&#8221; A
cunning smirk crossed Smithy&#8217;s countenance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t they know everything?&#8221; asked the
girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I haven&#8217;t told &#8217;em,&#8221; was the reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;And so you blackmailed him under threat of
telling, did you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he seemed to be willin&#8217;,&#8221; countered
Smithy evasively, &#8220;or he wouldn&#8217;t have paid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you write me that letter, Caldwell?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The boss here told me to,&#8221; motioning toward
Stelton.</p>
<p>&#8220;What reason did he give for telling you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Caldwell did not like this question. He turned
and twisted in his seat without replying, and shot
a quick glance at Stelton, uncertain what reply
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
was expected of him. But he got no help there.</p>
<p>Stelton was relishing the fear and anxiety of his
tool and watched to see which way the other&#8217;s
cowardice would lead him. He was quite unprepared
for the answer that came.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a long worm that has no turning,&#8221; someone
has remarked, and Caldwell had reached his
length. The pure cruelty of Stelton&#8217;s conduct revolted
him, and now, sure that Stelton could do
him no harm because of his tied hands, he took a
vicious dig at his former leader.</p>
<p>&#8220;He wanted to marry you himself,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and offered me a hundred dollars to write you
that letter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stelton sat for a moment open-mouthed at the
temerity of his subordinate and then leaped up
with a roar like the bellow of a bull.</p>
<p>Juliet pounded hastily on the floor, and the
sheepmen appeared just as Stelton fetched Caldwell
a kick that sent him half-way across the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take them both away,&#8221; ordered the girl, suddenly
feeling faint and ill after the mental and
physical struggle of the interview.</p>
<p>When the two had gone she sank back in her
chair and faced the awful facts that these men had
given her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Bud! Bud! My lover!&#8221; she cried brokenly
to herself. &#8220;I want you, I need you now to tell
me it is all a lie!&#8221;</p>
<p>She remained for several minutes sunk in a kind
of torpor. Then, as though she had suddenly
arrived at some great decision, she rose slowly,
but determinedly, and left the room. Finding
one of the men, she ordered her horse saddled
and retired to change her clothes.</p>
<p>Her mother came in and asked if she were
going riding alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, mother,&#8221; replied the girl quietly. &#8220;I
am going to Bud and find out the truth about him.
I cannot live like this any longer. I shall go crazy
or kill myself. But I promise you this, that I will
find father and bring him home to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The eyes of Martha Bissell clouded with long-suppressed
tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;God bless you, Juliet,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
live without him any longer.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>THE USE OF PHOTOGRAPHY</h3>
</div>

<p>It was noon and the great column of parched
animals and hot, dusty men had come to a halt
under their alkali cloud beside a little stream.
The foot-weary sheep and cattle, without the usual
preliminaries, lay down where they stood, relieved
for once from the incessant nipping of the dogs
and proddings of the men.</p>
<p>Sims, walking among the sheep with down-drawn
brows, noted their condition, how gaunt
they were, how dirty and weary, and shook his
head in commiseration. Had he but known it he
was as gaunt and worn-looking as the weakest of
them. Returning to where Larkin had dropped
in the shade of the cook-wagon, he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to make it to-night if the Old Boy
himself is in the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Larkin realized the seriousness of the situation.
Water and feed were plentiful, but owing to the
hurry of the drive the animals were starving on
their feet. Less than five miles away was the
Gray Bull River, the goal of their march. Once
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
across that and they would be out of the Bar T
range and free to continue north, for the next
ranch-owner had gone in for sheep himself (one
of the first to see the handwriting on the wall),
and had gladly granted Larkin&#8217;s flocks a passage
across his range.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I can&#8217;t understand is where all those
cowpunchers are,&#8221; continued Sims. &#8220;I&#8217;m plenty
sure they wouldn&#8217;t let us through if we was within
a foot of the river, they&#8217;re that cussed.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had hardly got the words out of his mouth
when from ahead of the herd appeared a horseman
at a hard gallop, quirting his pony at every
few jumps.</p>
<p>Pulling the animal back on its haunches at
the cook-wagon, the rider vaulted out of the saddle
and was blurting out his story almost before he
had touched the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Up ahead there!&#8221; he gasped. &#8220;Cow-punchers!
Looks like a hundred of &#8217;em. I seen
&#8217;em from a butte. I &#8217;low they&#8217;ve dug fifty pits
and they&#8217;ve stuck sharp stakes into the ground
pointed this way. They&#8217;re ready fer us, an&#8217; don&#8217;t
yuh ferget it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sims and Larkin looked at each other without
speaking. Now it was plain that the punchers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
had had plenty of reason for not molesting them;
they had been preparing a surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; that ain&#8217;t all, boss,&#8221; went on the rider.
&#8220;I took a slant through my glasses, and what
d&#8217;yuh suppose I seen? There, as big as life, was
old Beef Bissell an&#8217; Red Tarken, and a lot more
o&#8217; them cowmen. How they ever got there I
dunno, but it&#8217;s worth figurin&#8217; out of a cold winter&#8217;s
evenin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>This information came as a knockdown. The
two men questioned their informant closely, unable
to credit their ears, but the man described
the ranch-owners so accurately that there was no
room left for doubt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what&#8217;s become o&#8217; Jimmie Welsh and his
nine men?&#8221; asked Sims wonderingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe they&#8217;re captured; but I couldn&#8217;t see
anythin&#8217; of &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope,&#8221; said Bud slowly, &#8220;they aren&#8217;t captured.
They&#8217;re dead. I know Jimmie and his
men, and I picked them for that job because I
knew how they would act. Poor boys! If I get
through here alive I&#8217;ll put a monument where
they died.&#8221;</p>
<p>He ceased speaking, and a sudden silence descended
on all the company, for the other men had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
been listening to this report. Each man&#8217;s thoughts
in that one instant were with Jimmie and his nine
men in their last extremity at Welsh&#8217;s Butte, although
the site of the tragedy was as yet unknown
to them.</p>
<p>&#8220;What about the lay of the country?&#8221; Sims
finally asked of the scout.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dead ahead is the big ford, but that is what
the punchers have protected. I could see that
either up or down from the ford the water&#8217;s deep,
because there ain&#8217;t no bottoms there&mdash;the bank&#8217;s
right on top of the river.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is the next nearest ford?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ten miles northeast, this season of the
year,&#8221; was the reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thunderation, boss, what&#8217;ll we do?&#8221; inquired
Sims petulantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Call Lester, and we three will talk it over,&#8221;
said Bud, a half-formed plan already in his
mind.</p>
<p>Presently the three were alone and discussing
the situation. Bud proposed his scheme and outlined
it clearly. For perhaps a quarter of an hour
he talked, interrupted by the eager, enthusiastic
exclamations of Lester. When he had finished,
Sims lay back on his two elbows and regarded his
employer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If yuh keep on this-a-way, boss,&#8221; he remarked,
&#8220;I allow we might let yuh herd a few lambs next
spring, seein&#8217; yuh <i>will</i> learn the sheep business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bud grinned at the other&#8217;s compliment and
noted Lester&#8217;s enthusiasm. Then they plunged
into the details.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better ride your horse around by way of the
ford ten miles away,&#8221; were the instructions as
Lester saddled up. &#8220;Then you can come at &#8217;em
by the rear.&#8221;</p>
<p>No word of young Larkin&#8217;s intention had passed
about the camp, and the sheepmen watched with
considerable wonder the departure of the boy,
placing it to Bud&#8217;s fear of his receiving an injury
in the trouble that was almost surely bound to
happen that night.</p>
<p>At three o&#8217;clock in the afternoon, or thereabouts,
Lester, with his outfit strapped on his dejected
horse, rode slowly away from the sheepmen&#8217;s
camp.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, behind the various defenses that
had been erected against the coming of Bud Larkin
and his animals, the cowmen and their
punchers were making ready for their night&#8217;s battle.
The chief actor in these fevered preparations
was Beef Bissell, whose hatred of Larkin was
something to frighten babies with at night.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span></p>
<p>Since the gallant battle at Welsh&#8217;s Butte, Bissell
had changed some of his ideas regarding sheepmen
in general; but he had changed none regarding
Larkin in particular. It was now a matter
of pride and determination, almost of oath with
him, to fight this matter of the range to the finish.
The other cowmen stood by him out of principle
and because of the need of a unified stand by men
of their association.</p>
<p>So here in the last ditch, ready to sacrifice men,
animals, and money, wrong and knowing it, these
beef barons prepared to dispute the last inch of
their territory. It should never be said, they had
sworn, that sheep had crossed the cattle-range of
any of them. On this elevating platform they
proposed to make their fight.</p>
<p>To be perfectly just to all concerned, it is only
right to add that all who did not choose to remain,
either owners or punchers, were perfectly free to
withdraw, but in doing so they forfeited their
membership in the association. But one man had
taken advantage of this&mdash;Billy Speaker.</p>
<p>&#8220;If there&#8217;s any damage to be done, those sheep
have already done it. Why don&#8217;t yuh let &#8217;em
through, yuh ol&#8217; fat-head?&#8221; said Speaker to Bissell
as, with his cowboys, he threw his leg over the
saddle and started homeward.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span></p>
<p>Despite the havoc to their numbers occasioned
by the battle with Jimmie Welsh, all the others
stood by. With the cowboys this matter of war
and its hazards was a decided improvement over
the dangerous monotony of spring round-ups.
Moreover, as long as one remained able to collect
it, five dollars a day was several pegs better than
forty dollars a month and all found.</p>
<p>To-day as the late sun drooped low toward the
horizon revolvers and guns were being oiled, and
other preparations made for a vigorous campaign.
The camp backed directly on the river at the only
fordable spot within ten miles, the stream forming
the fourth side to a square, the other three
sides of which were breastworks of earth and
trenches.</p>
<p>A rope stretched from the three cook-wagons
served as a coral for the horses, and in it
were gathered fully sixty-five animals, waiting impatiently
to be hobbled, and turned out to feed.
They waited in vain, however, for it was a matter
of course that they should stand saddled and ready
for instant use.</p>
<p>Directly before the front of these earthworks
were the pits and <i>chevaux de frise</i> of sharp stakes
that had been reported to Bud. The intention
was to stampede the animals if possible, and run
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
them into the pits and upon the stakes while a force
of men, protected by the trenches, poured a withering
and continuous fire into the on-surging mass.
Meanwhile the greater force on horseback would
be engaging the sheepmen.</p>
<p>That the cowboys knew the location of the
flocks goes without saying, for had they not had
spies on the lookout, the telltale pillar of dust that
ever floated above the marching thousands would
have betrayed their exact position.</p>
<p>The sun had just dropped below the horizon,
when a man in the cowpunchers&#8217; camp discerned a
weary horse bearing a hump-shouldered rider disconsolately
in the direction of the ford. The man,
bore strange-looking paraphernalia, and could be
classified as neither fish, flesh, nor fowl&mdash;that is,
cowboy, sheepman, or granger.</p>
<p>Without pausing the man urged his horse into
the water at the ford, where it drank deeply. The
man flung himself off the saddle and, scooping the
water in his hands, imitated the horse&#8217;s eagerness.
When he had apparently satisfied an inordinate
thirst he looked up at the man across the river and
said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, could I git some grub in yore camp?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yuh better move on, pardner. This here&#8217;s
resky territory,&#8221; replied the other, his Winchester
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
swinging idly back and forth across the stranger&#8217;s
middle.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m hungry enough to take a chance,&#8221; was the reply
as Lester walked his mount deliberately
across the stream. &#8220;Besides, I want to do business
with yuh.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another man, hearing the controversy, came up
and ordered the newcomer away. Lester asked
him who he was.</p>
<p>&#8220;My name&#8217;s Bissell,&#8221; snorted the man.</p>
<p>Lester advanced the rest of the way to shore
his hand outstretched.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m plumb glad to know yuh,&#8221; he said. &#8220;My
name&#8217;s Skidmore, an&#8217; I&#8217;ve just come from the Bar
T. I take pitchers, I do&mdash;yessir, the best in
the business; an&#8217; if yuh don&#8217;t believe me, just look
at these.&#8221;</p>
<p>From somewhere in his saddle-bags Skidmore
whipped out two photographs and handed them
to Bissell.</p>
<p>There, looking at him, sat Martha, in some of
her long-unused finery, and Juliet, the daughter
who had until now been the greatest blessing of
his life.</p>
<p>Bissell started back as though he had seen a
ghost, so excellent and speaking were the likenesses.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they asked me to come an&#8217; take one of
yuh, Mr. Bissell,&#8221; went on the photographer.</p>
<p>&#8220;They did?&#8221; snapped Beef suspiciously.
&#8220;How&#8217;d they know where I was?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stelton told &#8217;em. I was there when he got
home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes&mdash;Stelton, of course,&#8221; apologized the
owner. &#8220;How d&#8217;ye take the blame things?
With that contraption yuh&#8217;ve got there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and I think there is still light enough for
me to get you!&#8221; cried Skidmore, snatching his outfit
from the back of his horse and starting hurriedly
to set it up.</p>
<p>By this time quite a crowd had gathered, some
of whom had never seen a camera in operation,
and none of whom had seen such pictures as
Skidmore was able to pass around.</p>
<p>Bissell posed with the embarrassed air of a
schoolboy saying his first piece, and after that
Skidmore was busy arranging his subjects long
after it was too dark to make an impression on
the plates. Finally, affecting utter weariness, he
asked for food, and the best in the camp was laid
before him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t do any more to-night,&#8221; he said when
he had finished. &#8220;But to-morrow I can take a
few; I have about half-a-dozen plates left.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I may not look as tidy to-morrow morning
as I do now,&#8221; remarked one puncher suggestively.
&#8220;Too bad yuh can&#8217;t take pictures at night as well
as in the daytime.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can,&#8221; announced Skidmore, quite complacently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, didn&#8217;t yuh just tell me,&#8221; demanded an
irate cowboy who vainly undertook to grasp the
science of photography, &#8220;that the light actin&#8217; on
the plate made the pitcher?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, how in the road to hell can yuh take
&#8217;em when it&#8217;s dark?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He rents a star, yuh fool!&#8221; volunteered another.</p>
<p>&#8220;I make my own light,&#8221; explained Skidmore.</p>
<p>&#8220;How? With a wood-fire?&#8221; asked the curious
puncher.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Shall I show yuh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The reply came in a chorus, for the arrival of
this man with his strange apparatus had created
a stir among his hosts that one cannot conceive in
these days of perfect pictures. The cowpunchers
were not worrying about attack, for they had outposts
on duty who could warn them of the advance
of the enemy in plenty of time. The amusement
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
of the camera was a fine thing with which
to pass the lagging hours.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Skidmore. &#8220;By George,&#8221; he
cried, &#8220;I&#8217;ve just the idea! My plates are low,
and I&#8217;ll take a picture of the whole outfit together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What! Get seventy men on the same thing
that&#8217;ll only hold one?&#8221; cried another puncher,
furious that these wonders eluded him. &#8220;If
yuh&#8217;re foolin&#8217; with me, son, I&#8217;ll shoot yer contraption
into a thousand pieces.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Easiest thing in the world,&#8221; said the photographer
carelessly. &#8220;Only I&#8217;ll have to ask yuh to
move away from the fire; that&#8217;ll spoil the plate.
I think over here is a good place.&#8221; He led the
way to a spot directly in front of the horse corral.</p>
<p>Then he caused the lowest row to sit on the
ground, the one behind it kneel, and the last stand
up, and after peering through his camera made
them close up tightly so that all could get into the
picture. By the glow from the camp-fire it was
a wonderful scene. The light showed broad hats,
knotted neckerchiefs, and weather-beaten, grinning
faces. It glanced dully from holsters and brightly
from guns and buckles.</p>
<p>On a piece of board Skidmore carefully arranged
his flashlight powder and took the cap off
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
the lens. Then he ran to the fire and picked up
a burning splinter, telling them all to watch it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Steady, now!&#8221; he commanded. &#8220;All
quiet.&#8221;</p>
<p>He thrust the lighted spill into the powder, and
there was a blinding flash, accompanied by a hollow
roar like a sudden gust of wind.</p>
<p>The next instant a terrific commotion arose in
the corral. There were squeals of terror, and before
the men could catch their breath the sixty-five
cow ponies had bolted in a mad stampede,
overturning the cook-wagons and thundering
across the prairie.</p>
<p>The punchers, absolutely sightless for the instant
from looking at the flash of the powder,
broke into horrible cursing, and ran blindly here
and there, colliding with one another and adding to
the already great confusion. Their one desire
was to lay hands on the wretched photographer,
but that desire was never fulfilled.</p>
<p>For Lester Larkin, having shut his eyes during
the flash, easily evaded the men and made his way
to his horse that had been tethered to a tree near
the river. With his instrument under his arm he
untied the animal, climbed on his back, and dug
in the spurs. A moment later, during the height
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
of the confusion, he was galloping along parallel
to the river. A mile and a half from the camp
he turned his horse&#8217;s head and sped at full speed
toward the advancing herds.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>THE CROSSING</h3>
</div>

<p>Darkness had scarcely fallen over the
Larkin flocks and herd when the former were
set in motion. The bells had been removed and
the sheep were urged forward at the fastest possible
pace.</p>
<p>Riders going by long détours had found a spot
on the banks of the river two miles up from the
camp of the cowmen where the water was not more
than five or six feet deep at most, though of considerable
swiftness. It was here that it had been
determined the sheep should cross. So, when the
last march was begun, the animals were driven at
an angle, avoiding all the pits and defenses of the
cowmen&#8217;s ingenuity.</p>
<p>The herders, some of them on horseback and
others on foot, did not speak. The only sounds
that rose from the densely packed flocks were the
clatter of their hard feet on the earth, the cracking
of their ankle bones, and an occasional bawl
of protest. But even this last was rare, for
the sheep, worn with fast traveling and ignorant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
of the meaning of the strange things that were
happening to them, were half-frightened; and
only contented flocks blether much.</p>
<p>Bud Larkin and Sims rode back and forth, one
on each side of the dim, heaving line, seeing that
the herders and dogs kept their places and preventing
any tendency to bolt.</p>
<p>An hour after the start half the distance was
accomplished. It was just at this time that Larkin,
looking northeast toward the camp of the
cowmen, saw a sudden brilliant flash of light, and
knew that Lester had succeeded in his daring
project. A moment later and the distant rumble
of the earth told him of the stampeded horses.</p>
<p>In depriving the cowboys of their ponies Larkin
had accomplished a master-stroke, for he had
played upon the one weakness of their equipment.
A cowboy without his horse is less effective than a
seal on land. His boots, tight-fitting and with
high heels, make walking not only a difficult operation,
but a painful one. Unaccustomed to this
means of locomotion, a puncher is weary and footsore
within two miles.</p>
<p>Aside from this fact, a cowboy disdains setting
his foot on the ground except in a cow town, and
even there daring ones sometimes rode their animals
into saloons and demanded their drinks. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
is a saying that a puncher will chase his horse half
a mile in order to ride a quarter of a mile on an
errand.</p>
<p>The <i>coup</i> of Lester Larkin had, therefore, left
the camp of the cowmen in serious straits. Afraid
to chase their animals and leave the camp deserted,
as soon as they recovered enough sight to
recognize their surroundings they took their places
in the trenches to carry on their defense as best
they could.</p>
<p>Busy as Larkin&#8217;s thoughts were with the duty
of getting his sheep safely across the river, his
mind occasionally flashed back to the rear of the
flock where the cook-wagons were trailing, for
there in the company of a friendly sheepman rode
Juliet Bissell.</p>
<p>Only that afternoon she had left the Bar T
ranch-house, and, directed by one of the men
guarding the rustlers there, had set out to find the
sheepmen&#8217;s camp. Not realizing how fast the
outfit was traveling, she had struck the trail far
to the rear, and had not overtaken Larkin until
just at the time when the sheep were set in motion.</p>
<p>Then she realized her mission would have to
wait until a later time. But so sweet and full-hearted
had been Bud&#8217;s joyful greeting that her
faith in him had again returned, and she rode
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
along meekly where he placed her, fond and comforted.</p>
<p>The proprieties of the situation never occurred
to her. She knew that she was safe in his hands,
and only bided the time when she could pour out
her sorrow and pain to him after all this struggle
was over.</p>
<p>To Bud her coming had been inexpressibly
sweet. He knew by her face that some great necessity
had driven her to him, but he did not question
her, and with the undisturbed security of a
clean conscience he wondered anxiously what had
occurred.</p>
<p>At the time when the sheep were half-way to
the river-bank there was another movement back
at the camp where the cattle had been left. Men
there working on schedule started the cattle-drive.
But this drive was not at any diverging angle. It
led straight forward to the pits and sharpened
stakes of the cowmen&#8217;s defenses.</p>
<p>Presently the outposts of the force by the ford
heard a distant rumbling of the earth. These
men on their horses&mdash;for they had not been in
camp at the time of the flashlight&mdash;rode slowly
forward and waited. But not long. Nearer and
nearer came the sound until there was no more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
doubt that an animal-drive was headed in their
direction.</p>
<p>Slowly they retreated to the camp and gave the
warning. Immediately the fire was extinguished,
and the punchers, still cursing over their misfortune,
loaded every available weapon, breathing a
hot and complete vengeance against the men that
had outwitted them. Much to their chagrin they
now recognized that Skidmore was but a clever
member of the enemy, for if he had not been they
felt that he would not have accomplished such a
speedy and well-planned escape.</p>
<p>Now, as the sheepmen drove their animals
nearer and nearer to the pits, they urged them
faster until the unhappy creatures, besides themselves
at the weird occurrences of a night of terror,
were at a headlong gallop.</p>
<p>Suddenly one of the punchers heard that unmistakable
accompaniment of running steers and
the clashing of horns as the animals with lowered
heads charged the works.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re cows!&#8221; he yelled. &#8220;Don&#8217;t shoot!&#8221;</p>
<p>But it was too late. The maddened cattle
were already at the first pits, plunging in with terrified
bellows, or being transfixed on the stakes
by the onrush of those behind. The pits were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
not more than ten feet deep, and only served to
check the herd until they were full. Then those
following trampled over their dying companions
and charged the trenches where the cowboys
lay.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fire!&#8221; yelled Bissell, who was in command,
and the guns of nearly seventy men poured a
leaden hail of death into the forefront of the
heedless cattle.</p>
<p>Larkin&#8217;s men by this time had drawn off to see
that the havoc ran its course, and when they heard
the desperate volleys they turned and rode southwest
along the river-bank to the point where the
sheep expected to cross.</p>
<p>The cattle, which had been driven in a rather
narrow column, continued to come on endlessly.
The leaders dropped in windrows, but the followers
leaped over them only to fall a little farther
on.</p>
<p>Driven by the resistless impulse of these behind,
the animals unconsciously appeared like a
charging regiment. Nearer and nearer the tide
approached the cowboys&#8217; defenses; but now it was
coming more slowly because of the dead bodies
and the wounded animals that dragged themselves
here and there, bellowing with pain and
terror.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span></p>
<p>At last, at the very mouths of the spitting guns
the last of the steers dropped, and the few that
remained alive turned tail and fled wildly back the
way they had come. In front of the trenches was
a horrible tangle of trampled, wounded creatures,
rearing as best they could and stabbing one
another with their long, sharp horns.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody out an&#8217; kill the ones that ain&#8217;t
dead!&#8221; yelled Bissell, and the cowboys leaped
over the breastworks on this hazardous errand of
mercy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are the sheep?&#8221; was the question
every man asked himself and his neighbor, but no
one could reply.</p>
<p>It had been reported to Bissell by the scouts
that with the sheep were a body of cattle. Consequently
when the steers charged all had expected
the sheep to follow. But in all that grisly
battle-field there was not a head of mutton to be
found, and the punchers looked at one another
in mystified wonder.</p>
<p>&#8220;They must be crossin&#8217; somewheres else,&#8221; said
Bissell, wringing his hands in despair. &#8220;Oh,
blast that man that stampeded them horses!&#8221;</p>
<p>The thought was in every man&#8217;s mind, for here
the beauty of that strategy was made manifest.
Uninjured, full of fight, and furious, the forces of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
the cowmen were helpless because they had nothing
to ride, and were utterly useless on foot.</p>
<p>Two miles away on the bank of the river
another scene was being enacted.</p>
<p>Here the eight thousand sheep had come to a
halt with the leaders on the very bank, and the
herders walking back and forth talking to them
to keep them quiet. The river was not more
deep than the height of a man, but the current
was swift and icy with the snows of the far-off
Shoshone Mountains.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you ready, boys?&#8221; sang out Larkin.</p>
<p>&#8220;All ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Strip and into it, then,&#8221; and, the first to obey
his own command, he hurried off his clothes and
plunged into the frigid river.</p>
<p>Sims, who had devised this scheme from memory
of an Indian custom, stood at the head of the
leaders to superintend the crossing.</p>
<p>Now the men entered the water by tens, and
stretched out in a double line all the way from
bank to bank, facing each other and leaving but a
scant yard between them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ready?&#8221; yelled Sims.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ready! Let &#8217;em go!&#8221; sang out Larkin.</p>
<p>The chief herder and others heaved the leading
sheep into the water between the first two men.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
These lifted it along to the next pair who shoved
it on, swimming all the time. So it came snorting
and blatting to the other side and climbed up the
bank.</p>
<p>After it came the next, and then the next, and
as the work became easier the sheep caught the
notion that man had suggested and incorporated
it into the flock mind. They took to the water
because their predecessors had.</p>
<p>And now the stream of sheep was steady and
continuous. The current was swift and the men&#8217;s
bodies ached and grew numb in the intense cold,
but they stood their ground. Only in one place
was the water too deep to work, and here they lost
a few terror-stricken animals who turned aside
from the chain and were swept downstream.</p>
<p>The river between the men was churned like
that of a rapid; there was heard the constant <i>slap-slap!</i>
of their arms as they smote the water in
pushing the sheep along. A man took cramp
and clung to a companion until he could kick it out
of himself.</p>
<p>At last, though, all the sheep had passed over
the river, and Bud Larkin had won!</p>
<p>Then came the getting over of the wagons and
camp outfits, all done in the dark, and with
scarcely sound enough to be heard a furlong away.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
As some men worked, others dressed and swam
the horses over, leading them in bunches.</p>
<p>Presently, dressed, happy, and glowing with the
reaction from his icy bath, Bud Larkin appeared
out of the dark beside Juliet Bissell.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are the one who has enabled me to do
all this,&#8221; he said gently. &#8220;Now, will you go over
with me or will you go down the river to your
father two miles away?&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked up at him proudly.</p>
<p>&#8220;To the victor belongs the spoils,&#8221; she said,
and lifted her face to him. &#8220;Are you going to
make me go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Darling!&#8221; he cried in the sweet, low voice
she loved and drew her to him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>THE STORY OF LESTER</h3>
</div>

<p>Bud&#8217;s sleep of exhaustion was ended by the
sound of voices calling to one another. So
deep had been his unconsciousness that as he slowly
struggled back to light and reason he forgot
where he was and what had happened.</p>
<p>One thing was certain, the sun had been up a
long while, and it was growing extremely hot even
under the sheltering cottonwood tree where he
lay.</p>
<p>The voices continued to call to one another, and
Bud finally sat up to investigate.</p>
<p>On the opposite bank another camp was being
made by bow-legged men who wore heavy chaps
over their trousers, broad hats, and knotted neckerchiefs.
Some of these men limped, and most of
them swore at their cramped toes as they went
about the business in hand.</p>
<p>A short distance away from where Bud sat
some of the sheepmen were lying comfortably on
their elbows, chaffing the punchers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I allow you cowmen&#8217;re gettin&#8217; pretty swell,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
remarked one. &#8220;They tell me yuh kinder hanker
after photygrafts of yerselves. How about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better lose a hoss fer the sake of yer good
looks than be a comic valentine all yore life,
what?&#8221; was the drawling retort.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe so, but if I&#8217;d lost hosses the way you
fellers did last night I wouldn&#8217;t have enough vanity
left no ways to look a pony in the left leg.
I&#8217;d go to raisin&#8217; grasshoppers to sell to old ladies&#8217;
chicken ranches, I plumb would.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this sally such a guffaw of laughter greeted
the discomfited punchers that they retired from
the field for the time being. Larkin grinned with
the rest. Then he turned his attention to the
little tent set up near by between two trees. He
remembered that Julie had slept there and
wondered if she were awake yet.</p>
<p>He called her name and presently a very sleepy
voice responded, so tender and helpless in its accents
that he laughed for joy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lazy girl!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Do you know what
time it is? I&#8217;ve been up for hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right; I&#8217;ll get up, I suppose. Is breakfast
ready?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not quite,&#8221; he replied seriously, &#8220;but I&#8217;ll
have the maid bring it in as soon as the eggs are
shirred.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Bud Larkin, you&#8217;re horrid!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t believe you have even started a fire. Do
you expect me to get your breakfast?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would tickle me silly,&#8221; he confessed, unrepentant.
&#8220;Shall I wait for you? You see the
cooks are getting dinner now. Breakfast was
over hours ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear, I suppose so! We&#8217;re not even
married and you want me to cook for you. Oh,
dear!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, relenting, &#8220;I&#8217;ll get things
started, but you come out as soon as you can.&#8221;</p>
<p>So saying he beckoned to Ah Sin who had been
waiting for the boss, and gave him a number of
orders. Then he thrashed about the river bank
as though looking for fagots, while Julie continued
pretending to mourn over her hard lot.
When at last she appeared, however, and had
dashed the sleep from her eyes in the icy waters
of the river, it was not to cook, but to sit down
at one of Ah Sin&#8217;s little tables and eat a glorious
breakfast.</p>
<p>&#8220;You perfect darling!&#8221; she cried happily and
ran and kissed Bud though the Chinaman was
looking on.</p>
<p>During breakfast she noticed the work going
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
forward on the other side of the river and asked
Bud about it.</p>
<p>&#8220;The cowmen moved their camp down here
opposite us as soon as they could find out where
we were,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;I guess they want to
talk with me regarding several matters. I&#8217;m
pretty sure I have a thing or two to say to them,
now that I am out of their clutches.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, then my father must be among those men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He must, although I have not seen him. I
intend to take you over to him immediately after
breakfast.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly for the first time, the girl&#8217;s face
clouded; through their sweet bantering pierced
the hideous visage of the thing that haunted her
and that she had come to ask him about.</p>
<p>&#8220;Talk to me a little while first, will you?&#8221; she
pleaded. &#8220;You know I came to see you for a
special reason last night but had no time to discuss
it then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, dear girl,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p>When they had finished eating they strolled a
little way up the noisy stream and finally found a
cozy nook between two trees. All about them
in the succulent grass of the banks and river bottoms
they could hear the bells and contented
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
blethering of the flocks; for Sims had determined
to rest his animals for a few days before starting
again the long trek north.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bud,&#8221; she began, speaking slowly so as to
choose her words, &#8220;I am going to ask you questions
about things that you have never chosen to
discuss with me for some reason I could not
fathom. If it is unmaidenly I am sorry, but I
must ask them. I cannot stand any more such
anxiety and pain as I have suffered in the last few
weeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bud&#8217;s features settled themselves into an expression
of thought that told the girl absolutely
nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, go on,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;First I want you to read this note,&#8221; she continued,
drawing a soiled bit of paper from the
bosom of her dress. &#8220;A photographer called
Skidmore was held up by the rustlers and asked to
bring it to the Bar T and give it to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her hand trembled a little as she held the
paper out to him. He took it gravely, unfolded
and read it.</p>
<p>Then he smiled his old winning smile at her
and kissed the hand she had extended.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lies! All lies!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Please think
no more about them.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span></p>
<p>She looked at him steadily and withdrew her
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;That won&#8217;t do, Bud,&#8221; she replied firmly, but
in a low voice. &#8220;What is the thing for which
Caldwell blackmailed you three years ago and
again this year?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bud looked at her quizzically for a moment,
and then seemed to recede into thought. She
waited patiently, and, after a while, he began to
speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose you are right,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It
is a woman&#8217;s privilege to know what a man&#8217;s life
holds if she desires it. There are but a few rare
souls who can marry men against whom the world
holds something, and say: &#8216;Never tell me what
you were or what you have done; what you are
and what you will be are enough for me.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Putting myself in your place, I am sure I
should do what you are doing, for I have always
told myself that those who marry with points unsettled
between them have taken the first step
toward unhappiness. Suspicion and deceit would
undermine the greatest love that ever existed.
Acts in the past that cannot be explained create
suspicion, and those in the present that are better
unobserved father deceit.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span></p>
<p>He paused for a few moments, and appeared to
be thinking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know who that Ed Skidmore is?&#8221; he
asked abruptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; only he was quite nice, and evidently
from the East.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is my brother Lester, and he is the man
who stampeded the punchers&#8217; horses last night
with his flashlight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is? I should never have suspected it;
you are absolutely different in looks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know we are, or I shouldn&#8217;t have risked his
life last night. Well, I bring him into this because
I have to. He is part of the story. Lester
was always a wild youth, particularly after the
governor stuck him on a bookkeeper&#8217;s stool and
tried to make a business man out of him. The
boy couldn&#8217;t add a column of figures a foot long
correctly inside of ten tries. I took to the game
a little better than he did, and managed to get
promoted occasionally. But Lester never did.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father believed, and announced often enough,
that anybody that couldn&#8217;t add figures and keep
accounts had no business to handle money. To
discipline Lester, who he thought was loafing
when he really was incapable, the governor cut off
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
the boy&#8217;s allowance almost entirely and told him
he would have to live on his wages until he
showed he could earn more.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Julie, you know what kind of a cad I
was back in the old days&mdash;rich, spoiled, flattered
by men, and sought after by women. (I can say
these things now, since I&#8217;ve learned their opposites!)
Just try to imagine, then, the effect of
such an order on Lester, who was always the
petted one of us two because he was small and delicate!
It was like pouring cold water on a red-hot
stove lid.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tied more than ever to his desk, Lester
wanted more amusements than ever. But he had
only about fifteen a week where he had been accustomed
to five times the amount. He drifted
and borrowed and pledged and pawned, and
finally was caught by some loan-sharks, who got
him out of one difficulty only to plunge him into
three others.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although my father had a narrow-gauge mind
as far as life in general is concerned, I will say this
for him: that he was right in everything he did
about business. He had made it a rule of the firm
that anybody who borrowed money was fired on
the spot. Lester knew this, and, while he would
have liked nothing better than the sack, he did not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
want to disgrace the governor before his employees
and all the business world. So he clung along
and tried to make a go of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must confess that I think some of the blame
for what followed should be laid at my door. I
had been patient with the kid and loaned him
money until I came to the conclusion that it was
like throwing it down a well. Then I got fond
of a certain person&#8221;&mdash;he paused a moment and
smiled at Julie&mdash;&#8220;and I needed all my money to
entertain her properly; so I quit loaning.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether to tell you the rest or
not; it isn&#8217;t what I would want anyone else to tell
you, even about a perfect stranger, but I think it
is right you should know everything if you know
anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl nodded without speaking.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the loan-shark office was a very pretty
little girl, and Lester thought he fell in love with
her. She had a red-headed cousin and an admirer
named Smithy Caldwell, who belonged to
a tough gang on the South Side.</p>
<p>&#8220;The girl was fond of Lester for a while, but
she wouldn&#8217;t forsake her friends as he ordered
her to, and they quarreled. Her name was Mary,
and after the fuss the three friends, together with
the loan-shark people, played Lester for a gilt-edged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
idiot, basing their operations on alleged
facts concerning Mary. In reality Smithy Caldwell
had married her in the meantime, and Lester
eventually proved he had always treated her
honorably, though now she denied it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor, innocent boy in the hands of those
blood-suckers!&#8221; cried Juliet compassionately.</p>
<p>&#8220;Naturally driven frantic by the fear of exposure
and the resulting disgrace of the whole
family, the boy lost his head and tried to buy his
persecutors off. And to do this he took money
out of the safe. But what&#8217;s the use of prolonging
the agony? Finally he forged my father&#8217;s signature,
and when the check came back from the
bank he tried to &#8217;fix&#8217; the books, and got caught.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll pass over everything that followed, except
to say that the disgrace did not become public.
But it broke father&#8217;s heart and hastened his
death. When that occurred it was found that
practically all the estate had come to me, and this
fellow Smithy Caldwell threatened to disclose the
forgery if I did not buy him off.</p>
<p>&#8220;That scared me, because I was now the head
of the family, and I handed over two thousand
dollars. Then I came West, and thought the
whole matter was buried, until Caldwell turned
up at the Bar T that night for supper.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s about all. You see, it&#8217;s an ugly story,
and it paints Lester pretty black. But I&#8217;ve
thought the thing over a great many times, and
can&#8217;t blame him very much, after all, for it
really was the result of my father&#8217;s stern and
narrow policy. The boy was in his most impressionable
years, and was left to face the music
alone. It seemed to age him mightily.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what will happen now?&#8221; asked Julie
anxiously. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t the other two still alive?
Can&#8217;t they make trouble?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but I don&#8217;t think they will. I have the
drop on Smithy now, and he will either write a
full dismissal of the matter for all three of them
or he will swing with the rustlers. And if I know
my Smithy Caldwell, he won&#8217;t be able to get pen
and paper fast enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But can you save him, even at that cost, do
you think? The cowmen won&#8217;t understand all
this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That will rest with your father, dear,&#8221; replied
Bud, getting to his feet. &#8220;Now, let&#8217;s go
over and see him, for I have something else I
want to ask him.&#8221;</p>
<p>His face that had been clouded during his recital
was suddenly flooded with the sunlight of his
smile, and Julie realized for the first time what it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
had cost him to lay bare again these painful memories
of a past he had sought to bury.</p>
<p>When he had helped her to her feet she went to
him and laid her hands on his shoulders, looking
up into his face with eyes that brimmed with the
loosed flood of her love, so long pent up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I ever be worth what I have cost you to-day?&#8221;
she asked humbly.</p>
<p>Tenderly he gathered her to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;In love there is no such word as cost,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>THE THREADS MEET</h3>
</div>

<p>It could not have been later than ten o&#8217;clock
in the morning when a puncher with sharp
eyes might have seen two figures approaching the
Bar T ranch house on horseback. They rode
needlessly close together and swung their clasped
and gauntleted hands like happy children.</p>
<p>One was a girl into whose radiant eyes a new
wonder had come, and the other a handsome,
tanned young man bathed in a deliriously happy
expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it jolly to be married without anyone&#8217;s
knowing?&#8221; cried Julie. &#8220;Oh, but won&#8217;t they be
surprised at home?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather!&#8221; remarked Bud, with a sobered expression.
&#8220;I only hope your father doesn&#8217;t widow
you just as I ride into the yard with the olive
branch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop it, Bud! What puts such awful thoughts
into your head?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Experience. Your father was so mad about
my getting the sheep across the river that he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
started his punchers walking home that same night,
and nobody has seen him since.&#8221;</p>
<p>Larkin spoke the truth, but little exaggerated.
Beef Bissell, humiliated, beaten, and forced to accept
the small end of a deal for once in his life,
had started from the useless cowmen&#8217;s camp by
the Gray Bull the very night of the crossing. He
ordered the men to follow and round up their
stampeded horses and then to ride home.</p>
<p>Meanwhile he appropriated one horse that had
not been in the corral and trotted homeward,
eaten by chagrin and beside himself with impotent
fury.</p>
<p>Bud and Julie had found this out the day of
their talk concerning Lester, when they forded
the stream on horses and asked for Bissell.
Under the circumstances Bud developed a genius
for inspiration that was little short of marvelous.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use of riding all the way home and
having a grand row with your father?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;Why not go over to Rattlesnake, where there&#8217;s
a sky-pilot, and be married? Then we&#8217;ll go
home, and there can&#8217;t be any row, because there
will only be one party in the mood for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the girl demurred. It was cruel to her
father and mother, she said, not to have them
present on the greatest day of her life. She allowed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
it was mighty ungrateful after all they had
done for her. Then Bud took her hand in his
and told her his principal reasons.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a business man, honey, and I&#8217;ve got to
start north after Simmy and the sheep in three or
four days,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Shearing is late now, but
I guess we can make it. This trouble has set me
behind close to fifteen thousand dollars, and everything
is in a critical state.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it don&#8217;t sound much like a lover, but
as soon as we get on our feet we&#8217;ll take a honeymoon
to Japan that will make you think I&#8217;d never
heard of a sheep.</p>
<p>&#8220;You want your mother and father in on the
joy, I know, but it doesn&#8217;t seem to me there can
be much joy with nine or ten men sitting around
waiting for their necks to be stretched. Does it
to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Julie, and shuddered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then come along over to Rattlesnake and be
married. Then we&#8217;ll ride back to the Bar T, so
you can see your folks, and I can see Caldwell.
We can be through and away before anything is
really done about the rustlers.&#8221;</p>
<p>So it was arranged, and the two were married
by an Episcopal clergyman who had a surplice
but no cassock, and whose trouser-legs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
looked very funny moving about inside the thin,
white material&mdash;and Julie nearly laughed out
loud.</p>
<p>After the ceremony they had ridden out of
town with their equipment and made their first
honeymoon camp in a cool, green place beside a
little brook that had trout in it and sang to them
for hours on end.</p>
<p>Now, the day afterward, they were on the way
home, and not without a few secret misgivings.</p>
<p>As they neared the Bar T a single man rode out
to meet them. It was Lester, who had come the
night before and was waiting for Bud, so as to be
present at the interview with Smithy Caldwell,
whom he had not yet seen.</p>
<p>He congratulated the pair warmly and rode with
them to the corral.</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a shriek, and Martha Bissell
tore out of the cook-house. She ran to Julie,
kissed her, and welcomed her back; then when
she heard the news she picked up her apron to
start crying, and dropped it again, undecided what
to do.</p>
<p>What with Bissell&#8217;s safe arrival and Julie&#8217;s
glorious home-coming the poor woman was nearly
out of her mind.</p>
<p>The excitement brought Beef Bissell around the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
house from the front veranda, where he had been
grumbling and swearing all the morning. At
sight of Larkin he halted in his tracks and began
to redden. But he got no farther, for Julie
flung herself into his arms, tears of happiness
streaming down her face, and overwhelmed him
with caresses.</p>
<p>Bissell was mightily relieved to see her. In
fact, it had been all his wife could do to restrain
him from starting out to unearth Julie when he
arrived home and found her gone. But Martha
said that the girl had gone to find Larkin, and
added that the two were old enough to settle their
troubles between them. So Bissell, remembering
his last miserable interview with his daughter, decided
not to interfere.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father, I&#8217;m married; please be happy and
good to me,&#8221; the girl said, clinging to him, and
the fury that had flown to his head like wine died
a natural death. After all, to see her happy was
what he most wanted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure he will love you always?&#8221; he
asked gently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, father, I am. I refused to marry him
long ago in Chicago.&#8221; He kissed her for the first
time in a long while, and then gently disengaged
himself and took a step toward Bud.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Larkin,&#8221; he said, &#8220;yuh were always lucky,
but yuh&#8217;ve beat all records for Wyoming now. I
allow yuh can take her away with yuh on one condition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That yuh never beat her like yuh beat me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Agreed!&#8221; laughed Bud, and grasped the
other&#8217;s hand. &#8220;But can you stand a sheepman in
the family?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I sure can, Larkin. Ever since I seen Jimmie
Welsh and his men fight, I ain&#8217;t got anythin&#8217;
against sheepmen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jimmie Welsh!&#8221; cried Bud. &#8220;Tell me, did
any of his party come through alive?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jes&#8217; Jimmie himself; the boys couldn&#8217;t kill
him, so he&#8217;s over at Billy Speaker&#8217;s mendin&#8217; up.
Heart&#8217;s pretty near broke because he hasn&#8217;t seen
yuh to explain why he&#8217;s still alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good old Jimmie!&#8221; said Bud, the tears leaping
to his eyes. &#8220;Dearest,&#8221; he added, turning
to Julie, &#8220;there&#8217;s one more stop on our honeymoon,
and that&#8217;s at Billy Speaker&#8217;s to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bissell continued the conversation, and asked
for the full story of how Bud had run down and
captured the rustlers, saying that the whole cow
country owed him a debt, and if they had only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
known of the capture in time would have let his
sheep through without protest.</p>
<p>&#8220;I imagined as much,&#8221; remarked Bud; &#8220;but I
didn&#8217;t care to get them through that way once I
had started the other. I hope, Mr. Bissell, that
we can be friends, although we have been enemies
up to now. I&#8217;m sorry I had to sacrifice those
cattle of the association, but there was no other
way out of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell yuh this, Larkin,&#8221; returned Bissell.
&#8220;Anybody that can beat me at anything is good
enough to be my friend fer life, an&#8217; I&#8217;m here to
state that yuh could count my friends of that type,
before you came, on the hairs of a hairless dog!&#8221;</p>
<p>Bud laughed, they shook hands again, and
peace was finally made between them; but not until
Beef Bissell had signed away half of the interest
in the Bar T to Julie as her dower.</p>
<p>That was a happy and hilarious dinner at the
ranch. Some of the cowboys coming in at noon
from near-by ranges heard of the marriage and
cheered the bride lustily when she appeared on the
veranda. Bud made himself solid with the disgruntled
punchers by walking out to them and talking
over the battle of Welsh&#8217;s Butte, while he
rolled cigarettes and smoked them one after
another.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span></p>
<p>Shortly afterward, Bud and Lester found themselves
in a room with Smithy Caldwell. The
blackmailer, when he saw Lester, fell down in a
faint, so great was the shock to his already
wrecked nervous system. The man was really in
a terrible condition both from physical fear and
the tormenting by his comrades. He started at
every slight sound, whirled about fearfully to meet
any footfall that sounded near, and trembled with
uncontrollable nervous spasms.</p>
<p>To both the Larkins he was a piteous sight, and
Bud wondered that the miserable creature had not
gone mad.</p>
<p>The wretch fell on his knees and pleaded with
them for his life, so that when Bud put the proposition
squarely up to him that he forswear everything
in regard to the Larkin family, he could not
accept it eagerly enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;But about the papers that you said were in
Chicago?&#8221; asked Bud.</p>
<p>&#8220;I lied about them,&#8221; replied Smithy.
&#8220;They&#8217;re sewed in the lining of my shirt. Give
me your knife and I&#8217;ll get &#8217;em for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me your shirt and I&#8217;ll find them,&#8221;
countered Bud; and he presently did.</p>
<p>Together the brothers looked them over. Every
bit of incriminating evidence was there, and as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
Bud slipped it all into his pocket he gave a great
sigh: &#8220;Thank Heaven, that&#8217;s over!&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not let Caldwell off, however, without
securing from him the written and signed statement
that he wanted. When all was done they
let him go, and now his mind was almost as unbalanced
by joy as it had formerly been by fear.</p>
<p>Bissell, knowing Caldwell&#8217;s condition, had
agreed to his being released on clearing his account
with the Larkins, for he realized that the
man, in fearing death, had suffered the penalty a
thousand times, and that the memory would remain
with him through life, and perhaps help keep
him straight.</p>
<p>Shortly after Bud and Lester had joined the
others on the veranda again, a sudden scream was
heard from the bunk-house, followed by the
sounds of a terrible struggle. All hands rushed
around to the rear and, with drawn revolvers,
forced an entrance among the sullen rustlers.</p>
<p>On the floor in the middle of the room lay
Smithy Caldwell, white and contorted, while Mike
Stelton was just rising from his prostrate body,
making sounds in his throat like a wild animal.
Smithy was dead.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;d it happen, boys?&#8221; asked Bissell.</p>
<p>&#8220;This here Caldwell come out an&#8217; &#8217;lowed as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
how he wasn&#8217;t goin&#8217; to swing like the rest of us, an&#8217;
he began packin&#8217; up his truck. Stelton asked him
about it, an&#8217; when Smithy repeated what he said
before and got plumb cocky about it, Mike there
smeared him plenty. Then he broke his neck.
Smithy betrayed Stelton, yuh know.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is not much more to tell, except that,
three days later, the rustlers paid the penalty of
their lawless daring. It was the biggest &#8220;hangin&#8217;
bee&#8221; Wyoming had ever seen, and was largely
attended by men of all sections who stood for right
and justice, if not law and order.</p>
<p>Bud and Julie brought pride and sunlight to
a slowly recuperating Jimmie Welsh on their way
north, and from him and Billy Speaker heard
again the details of the great fight. Now, if you
go to Welsh&#8217;s Butte, you will see a tall white shaft
rising amid the tumbling of the wretched hogbacks.
On one side are the names of the sheepmen
who fell (including Jimmie, who is still alive),
and on the other those of the cowmen. It is the
humble offering of Bud and Julie Larkin.</p>
<p>Time has proven that Bud&#8217;s prophecy in regard
to sheep was right. Wyoming has far more
sheep than cattle now, and one of the biggest of
the ranches is the former Bar T, run under the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
Larkin name, in connection with the home ranch
in Montana.</p>
<p>I hope it will not be a shock to some readers to
know that the first Bud and Julie have another
Bud and Julie, who are over twenty years of age,
quite old enough to have romances of their own.</p>
<p>All their lives they have heard the story of the
adventures that brought their parents together,
but all four rather sadly admit that the Free
Range, which Bud fought for so hard, is now
almost a thing of the past, that the great drives
have passed never to return, and that the cowboy
himself is a dim figure against the prairie
sunset.</p>

<p>Illustrated by F. C. Yohn.</p>
<p>The &#8220;lonesome pine&#8221; from which the
story takes its name was a tall tree that
stood in solitary splendor on a mountain
top. The fame of the pine lured a young
engineer through Kentucky to catch the
trail, and when he finally climbed to its
shelter he found not only the pine but the
<i>foot-prints of a girl</i>. And the girl proved
to be lovely, piquant, and the trail of
these girlish foot-prints led the young
engineer a madder chase than &#8220;the trail
of the lonesome pine.&#8221;</p>
